Purple Gun: Peace Maker, Mass Imploder, Super Nova. Dark Jak's moves are: Dark Bomb, Dark Blast, Shadow Invisibility, and Dark Strike. Light Jak's moves are: Light Regeneration, Flash Freeze, Light Shield, and Light Flight. For transport you will get: JetBoard, Leaper Lizard, Monk Glider, Dark Maker Bot(like Titan Suit from Jak 2), Zoomer, Flyer, Cruiser, Hellcat Cruiser, Transporter, Tough Puppy, Sand Shark, Gila Stomper, Dune Hopper, Slam Dozer, Heat Seeker, Dust Demon, and Desert Screamer.

I like this game especially the new gamebraker and the "off the heazy" and the " Back 2 Papa" technique. It was even better with all the street legends: Earvin Johnson, Larry Bird, James Worthy, Isiah Thomas, Clyde Drexler, Moses Malone, Dominique Wilklins, Wilt Chamberlain, Jerry West, David Thompson, Rick Barry, Connie Hawkins, Bill Walton, Julius Erving, Walt Frazier, Earl Monroe, George Gervin, Pete Maravich, Oscar Robertson, Elgin Baylor, Bill Russell, and last but not least Michael Jordan. I give this movie a 5 out of 5.

I was searching through the booklet and came across the name "David Kaye," I thought I've seen this name before, so I went here to find out more. After searching Metal Gear Solid and finding out that the Ninja is played by Pinky from Pinky and the Brain and that Liquid Snake was Ryudo in Grandia 2, i search this game and there it was: David Kaye as Clark.

(Warning to all Parents and Squeamish Game Players: Grand Theft Auto 3 contains EXTREMELY profane, sexual, violent, indecent, gory, and immensely amoral subjects.Be Warned Grand Theft Auto 3 SHOULD NOT BE PLAYED by ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 18 or by Anybody easily offended by anything morally controversial. You've Been Warned!!)Let's begin by saying DMA Designs and Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto 3 is irrefutably the most maturated video game ever released on a video game console as of yet. In this markedly distressing nevertheless infinitely engaging tale of self-serving criminal vengeance, irresistibly intoxicating mayhem, comically tinted mass violence, astoundingly appealing depravity, and colorfully frank sexuality, you play an ex-con delinquent, living in the criminally afflicted and militantly run metropolis of Liberty City, who has recently has been betrayed by his former girlfriend in a high-profile bank robbery. After being found unanimously guilty by a jury, this incarcerated hoodlum becomes inadvertently liberated by a gruesome surprise jailbreak, spectacularly near identical to that of a modern film, which leaves our &quot;hero&quot; absolute free reign to sow his primal oats in typical Grand Theft Auto fashion.Utterly free to unconditionally do anything his little thieving heart desires, your character has the exceptional versatility to solicit for immeasurably titillating criminal assignments from a vast array of mob bosses to progress further up the illegal ladder of success, steal infinite numbers of cars, trucks, and emergency vehicles (70 vehicles in all including: police cars, S.W.A.T. Trucks, Emergency Medical Vehicles (EMS), Fire Trucks, F.B.I. cars, and Military Tanks) for all his practical immoral needs, purchase and discover all types of wholesome tools of mass destruction and serial homicide including: pistols, Uzi's, M-16's, Flamethrowers, remote-control cars, Grenades, Molotov Cocktails, Sniper Rifles, and the inestimably gratifying baseball bat, mug to your hearts content, play an implausible number of mini-games (Taxi missions, Fire-fighter missions, Police Vigilante missions, Ambulance missions), and even call out for prostitutes. This game embarks upon an exclusively innovative and ingeniously diversified pinnacle of video game interactive-ness and adaptability that will virtually stupefy all who play it and absorb it's players into the refreshing exuberance of it's fiendishly addictive gameplay and massively varied options.In this expansive grandly phenomenal visual 3D conversion from GTA's generally graphically lackluster 2D origins, Grand Theft Auto 3 also currently represents the unquestionably finest polygonal work yet seen on the Playstation 2 console (until most likely Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty). Besides it's explicitly lifelike characters, superbly authentic looking automobiles, and thoroughly impressive frame-rate, GTA3's sound system in particular is liberally fantastic for it's exceptionally vast radio selections. Like it's previous incarnations, GTA3 has a radio system where you can listen to music in about every vehicle in the game. However, GTA3 amplifies this option by allowing you to choose between seven or so different radio stations each with it's own particular musical genre, commercial advertisements, and a viable host. Choosing among Classical, Reggae, Talk Radio (My Favorite), Pop, Techno, and others, GTA3's radio archives (about 5 hours worth) contributes incalculably to the game's hugely expansive appeal in even more unforeseen ways.Grand Theft Auto 3 is an extraordinarily magnificent cinematic video gaming experience that despite it's ethically controversial content symbolizes everything categorically glorious and superlatively outstanding about the video game forum.Not to be missed for ALL the tea in China. A Must-Buy for any fan of Adult Gaming.

Primal progresses through four realms in the Parallel world of Oblivion. In Each realm her appearence changes dramatically and each realm is ruled by either the forces of order or chaos, and something major is messing up the balance.Unusually, unlike other games, which claim to be deep and fantastical and try to be as complex and open-ended as possible, Primal sesigners have devised a storyline, which is stuck to throughout the game, wearing it's linear nature with pride.Reasons for buying it:-Deep, dark and huge.-Broad, intultive puzzles.-Very nasty monsters.Reasons for leaving it:-Vague sense of being unfaithful to Mrs Croft-Not a game that gets along with natural light.-Where's the mini-gun?(AS YOU SEE DIGGING HARD FOR BAD POINTS!)Graphics/visuals: Gorgeous. Slinky characters, near-edible textures!9.4/10Sound: Alf soaring and dramatic. Decent acting!8.9/10Gameplay: Simple, fun. Combat a teeny bit simplistic.8.2/10Life span: Huge and linear. The save-anywhere option is great.8.6/10OVERALL SCORE AND THOUGHTS:I give this 8.8/10 (88%)-A finely crafted adventure, which reveals its depths gradually, unfolding at a pace to suit even the most fantasy-challenged.

When Jen Tate and her rock star boyfriend leave a wild dance hall to go pay the rent, the last thing they expect is to be attacked and beaten within an inch of their lives by a gigantic demon.  Lying in an emergency recovery room, Jen leaves her body and meets Scree, a gargoyle turned guide, and is drawn into Oblivion and the center of the demonic worlds where chaos and order fight a continuous battle.  Unfortunately, chaos is winning, and it will take Jen's special powers to restore the balance.Jen and Scree work their ways through four different demon realms all superbly detailed, restoring or creating order and improving their skills for the last titanic fight.  The game requires equal amounts of battle skills and thought - Only Jen can fight, but it takes Scree's talents as well to overcome some of the ingenious obstacles in their path. As the game progresses, Jen acquires special demonic powers in each realm.  The player switches between the to characters - depending on what skills are needed.Primal is a winner at many levels.  The characters, Jen and Scree, are delightful.  Jen is a rocker who is determined to work her way up and make good.  Scree, a spirit torn from his body and thrust into a statue, plays the part of the wise straight man.  The dialog between them is full of little twists and barbs, but it is clear that a great deal of affection builds between them as the story evolves.The realms of the story are immense and beautifully illustrated; their civilizations believable and interesting.  The only flaw in the world building is that there are only a few characters other than Jen and Scree that achieve any personality.  Animation and movement control are excellent.  This isn't one of those RPG's where the controller is the real opponent.Primal is rated as mature - primarily due to blood and violence.  Jen's language has a rough edge as well.  From my viewpoint, none of these factors is extreme - parts don't go flying everywhere, etc., but the Primal is definitely pitched to the 15+ age group.  Even so, this is really too good a game to miss.

A) A PS2 sitting in the vertical stand is one of the coolest looking things known to man. (It's a lot sturdier and more well made than it looks in photos, too.)B) Besides being space-economical and pleasing to the eye, it's part of a great tongue-in-cheek inside joke from Ken Kutaragi, designer of the PSX and PS2: The very first model of the original PSX manufactured back in 1994/1995 had a tendency to overheat, and this would warp some of the plastic parts in the disc drive. Thusly the laser would sometimes get a little out of alignment and have problems reading disc data, and many PSX owners found that putting the unit on its side would alleviate the problem. And so, with a wink and a nudge, we have the PS2 vertical stand.

Back in 1997, almost all gamers were talking about the debut of Squaresoft's Final Fantasy VII for the PSX. I, never having played an RPG before that point, played a demo of the FFVII at my cousins house (that was packaged with Square's Tobal No.1 - little known fighting game). That christmas I asked Santa for a Playstation and a copy of FFVII. Sanata delievered and I enjoyed and occupied myself for many hours that christmas...But this review is about Wild Arms. After I had completed FFVII after the holidays, my classmate lent me his copy of Wild Arms. While Wild ARMS didn't contain all the hype and flash that FFVII had going for it (far from it in some aspects), I felt the game overall was a real winner.Even five years after it's release I still can't praise this game enough. Graphically the game is very out-of-date by today's standards, but one must realize the game's graphics were out-of-date the minute FFVII flexed it's polygonal mucsles only a few months later. If your rating how good an RPG is by it's graphics, then you are not a true RPG fan in any way, shape, or form.Graphics was never the series' strong point, even though the graphics for Wild ARMS 2 were very well done (outside of the battle system mind you!), and Wild ARMS 3 cell-shading was nice (but kinda dull overall).What really made Wild ARMS such a strong game is the excellent character development that easily rivals ANY square-enix title (I'm not afraid to make such a bold statement!). When you really start to feel for the game's characters, espeically when tradegy strikes them, you know you have a winner. Even the game's villians are very well developed and very, very memorable (I still refer to them in gaming conversations after all this time). Some may say the story is your typical save-the-world fare, but I still think it beats the heck out of some of the plotlines in games today (where original ideas seem to be lacking overall).Wild ARMS, simply put, is a classic. Personally, I would put this above FFVII in terms of my overall favorites, even though I played FFVII first (FFVII still being another one of my top favorites). Even if your a new to Wild ARMS, or a fan, this is one RPG not to overlook.Hmmm... I wonder what the PSX2 remake, Wild ARMS: Alter Code F is going to be like?

I don't know what it is about the Playstation 2 (PS2), but it calls out to you to be put into the vertical position.  It just looks better standing veritcal rather than horizontal.  That extra overhang on the right side just looks kinda sloppy when sitting horizontally.  But I had a problem.My television and consoles are all on a black steel wire shelves.  When set on its side, the PS2 was on unsteady ground on my shelves.  Then I saw that this stand was available.  I decided to do some comparative shopping, but there was really no contest.There are several stands available for the PS2, both horizontal and vertical.  I haven't the faintest idea what the point is to the horizontal one, it neither adds to the visual appeal of the system nor the stability.  I could be mistaken, but I don't think there is a danger of knocking the PS2 over while it's lying horizontally.  The other vertical stands were all black and very cheap looking.Installation is very simple.  You just take it out of the box and slide the PS2 in the groove with the notched section in the back.  The front of the stand should be flush with the inset part of the PS2's &quot;bottom&quot; side.  After that, turn the Playstation logo on the drive tray a quarter turn clockwise and she's ready to go.As for disc scratching, I haven't had a problem.  I don't know how the PS2 &quot;loads&quot; the discs once the door is closed.  I've heard enough talk to where it seems like the PS2 may scratch them in either position.  I'm not going to lose any sleep over it.

Medal of Honor Allied Assualt is quite possibly the best WWII game ever. The graphics are great, the gameplay is the best ever.The weapons are even historical accurate! Get guns ranging from aColt .45, M1 garand, Thompson, BAR (browing automatic rifle), both U.S. frag grenade and a German one that looks like a black baloon at the end of a stick, get a Winchester shotgun, bazooka,operate a tank, mounted machine guns, and much more.I beat this game and was awarded five medals, The Leigion of Merit, The Norwegian War Cross with Sword, The American Campaign Medal, The Good Conduct Medal, and the Bronze star.Here are the good things about MOHAA:Over 20 authentic war weapons.Beuatiful graphicsThe D-day mission is worth [the price].The best war game---EVER!Six missionsYou will never get bored____________________________________________________________Bad things:A few graphical glitchesNo bloodHeavilly scripted AIAs I said, it's a good game, well-worth the hype, the AI can domany things, including: jump on grenades, run for cover, duck, and much more! But it is heavilly scripted, I once threw a grenade in a room with four Germans, one of the soldiers jumped on it, saving the others, but then he got up and started shootingat me.Overall, it's a good game the D-day mission is good, although it copies "Saving Private Ryan" way to much.

This WW2 combat game puts you behind the Axis front near the waning months of the war to end fascism in Europe (tunfortunately Communism took over after the war in Eastern Europe).  You play an American soldier who begins the mission storming the beaches of Nazi-occupied Northern France, and continue through killing schusstaffel soldiers with weapons like shotguns, M-1 rifle, colt 45 pistol, the sniper rifle, grenades. grenade launcher, etc...  The game is a first person shooter with beautiful nearly photo-realistic graphics and intense sound effects.  This game would be perfect if 1) aiming the weaponry was a little more control-friendly to the gamer, and 2) more realistic physics (enemies in reality probably do not lean over and fall down dead peacefully after being hit in the chest with a 70 pound tank gun bullet fired from a Sherman at 50 yards)  The levels get increasingly difficult and some are rediculously impossible.  other than those three things, the game is a good buy.

You play an American soldier who begins the mission storming the beaches of Nazi-occupied Northern France, and continue through killing schusstaffel soldiers with weapons like shotguns, M-1 rifle, colt 45 pistol, the sniper rifle, grenades. grenade launcher, etc...  The game is a first person shooter with beautiful nearly photo-realistic graphics and intense sound effects.  This game would be perfect if 1) aiming the weaponry was a little more control-friendly to the gamer, and 2) more realistic physics (enemies in reality probably do not lean over and fall down dead peacefully after being hit in the chest with a 70 pound tank gun bullet fired from a Sherman at 50 yards)  The levels get increasingly difficult and some are rediculously impossible.  other than those three things, the game is a good buy.
I cant wait to get this game. I have 5 Medal of Honor games. I have Medal of Honor Rising Sun, Medal of Honor Frontline, Medal of Honor Allied Assault, Medal of Honor Breakthrough and Medal of Honor Spearhead. I liked them all. I also want Call of Duty Finest Hour for PS2. I cant wait.

If you have ever wondered what hell might look like, Dante's Inferno offers an incredibly vivid and detailed hypothesis. The game is based on the 14th-century Italian poem by Dante Alligheri, but Dante never could have imagined a hell this visually captivating. The walls themselves crawl with the bodies of the damned, other lost souls intermitently rain from the sky burning in torturous flames. In the distance, great columns of souls can be seen marching along monolithic causeways. The air is acrid with smoke and charred flesh, pierced by screams, fitful sparks and motes of ash. Each of the nine circles is here, along with the river Acheron and Limbo, and each setting is distinctive and fiendishly impressive. Through it all Vergil is your guide, just as in the poem, explicating the diabolic machinations of hell's machinery with insuperable aplomb.The gameplay is fluid and satisfying, with Dante boasting an array of combos with either his scythe, stolen from Death himself, or his cross. There are a variety of trinkets to collect - from the 30 pieces of silver received in ramsom by Judas to dozens of relics that Dante can equip to enhance his abilities. You can choose either to redeem or punish vanquished foes, and this will determine whether your scythe or your cross is fortified. The numerous boss fights show off the game's impressive scale to excellent effect.I had very high hopes for this title, but it has far exceeded even those. This game is one of the best I have ever played. If you are at all interested in the subject matter, I strongly recommend it.

I consider this to be a brilliant mechanic that serves to immerse the player in a very personal manner, as it tends to compel the player to actually reflect on his/her own views of sin and punishment before deciding a Lost Soul's ultimate fate. Very well-executed.I had very high hopes for this title, but it has far exceeded even those. This game is one of the best I have ever played.Do your self a favor and BUY DANTE'S INFERNO!!
A long time ago I picked up a role-playing game at Gen Con titled "Abyss" which was a reimagining of "Dante's Inferno" on steroids. It was gloriously violent, decadent, and imaginative.  When the Open Game License was released for Dungeons & Dragons came out, I was convinced this was the chance for "Abyss" to triumphantly return and, after tracking down the license holder and a publisher, wrote an entire book for the game.  But then the 4th Edition of D&D; was released and the publisher's interest waned. "Dante's Inferno," the video game by Visceral Games, is what I imagine that tabletop game would have looked like.When I completed my manuscript I sent it to my cousin, arenowned scholar)on "Dante's Inferno."  He demurred criticism, explaining that he had never played a video game before (it was a tabletop game remember) but that he appreciated the effort.  I imagine that's the response most people familiar with Dante Alighieri's "The Divine Comedy" will feel about this game: it's not very accurate, but if the kids are interested in literature that's a good thing, right?In the video game, Dante Alighieri (Graham McTavish) is transformed from an Italian poet to a Templar Knight on the Third Crusade. A deeply flawed warrior, he manages to break his vow to Beatrice (Vanessa Branch) before slaughtering Muslim prisoners of war at the city of Acre.  Sin and death surrounds Dante, from his doomed fellow crusader and brother-in-law Francesco (Tom Tate) to his brutal father Alighiero (JB Blanc) to his forlorn mother Bella (Pollyana McIntosh).  Dante's disillusionment is central to the belief that as a Templar his soul is untouched by the murders he commits - it is a credit to "Dante's Inferno" that it takes on such weighty matters as the Papal Bull of the Crusade. But Dante is one tough mother, so when he is stabbed in the back and death comes for him, Dante wrestles the Geiger-like scythe from him and proceeds on a quest to return to Beatrice...only to discover that Satan has absconded with her soul into hell.  Thus begins Dante's descent, accompanied only by the poet Virgil (Bart McCarthy).And that's the part we've all been waiting for: fighting in literature's most infamous hellscape. The nine circles of hell are lovingly (hatefully?) inspired by Hieronymous Bosch and other medieval artists: ferrying with Charon, battling Minos, resisting Cleopatra, slaying the many-mouthed Cerberus, facing his father's greed, and overcoming the gigantic fire demon Phlegyas.It's impossible not to learn about the original text by playing "Dante's Inferno" - a quote flies at you every time you die.  There are a variety of damned souls throughout that can be saved or condemned through mini-games which in turn gives you new powers, all of them drawn from the poem.  You can't help but admire a game that's willing to teach you a piece of classic literature even as you beat it up.There are a lot of flourishes in "Dante's Inferno" that have nothing to do with the poem and everything to do with its predecessors, "Devil May Cry" and "God of War," from the big honking scythe to the fact that Dante can fight for up to ten seconds in mid-air, from the completely unnecessary tassels that dangle from his arms to the power-ups that reward you for button mashing.  This is a game where strategy is not so much rewarded as beaten out of you. And yet "Dante's Inferno" is also a jumping, puzzling game, brutally uncompromising in sending Dante to his doom.  The medium difficulty is just about right for fighting but makes many of the other challenges too hard; the easy setting makes the various puzzles surmountable but the fighting too easy.By the sixth circle the creative team behind "Dante's Inferno" seems to have run out of steam.  Whereas in the previous circles we were gifted with whirling two-headed demons that spilled gold, corrupt infants with blades for hands, moaning temptresses with tentacles unfurling from their abdomens, and shuddering behemoths of disgusting filth, the sixth circle just starts repeating itself.  We get horned demons, then horned demons with axe and shield, and then horned demons with wings and two swords that can turn into flames.  The eighth circle with its ten "bolgie" is the worst, as a narrator explains the sinners and sins rather than actually showing them - after spending hours with wailing corpses flailing, boiling, and skewered, it's obvious the design team ran out of ideas and budget. Things don't pick up again until the last circle, when you face down Satan himself.  Compared to earlier battles, the final fight was a cakewalk.The end of "Dante's Inferno" isn't the end of course - in the game or in the poem - but it will be interesting to see if Visceral Games can make Purgatory just as compelling.
This is perhaps the most hard-boiled, brutal, most violent game ever made; n' dat's what made it 1 uv da greatest.  N' dis game, da world iz yourz.

Many have speculated that SSX: Tricky is nothing more than a re-hash of the original SSX.  Nothing could be further from the truth.There are new boarders, new courses, and new tricks.Sure, your favorite boarders and courses are still here this time around, but all have had a makeover. Like... Elise's new hair cut and the fact that Snowdream is no longer the first, and easiest course to contend with. Oh, and you heard that celebrities did most of the character voices, right? David Arquette, Billy Zane, Lucy Liu, Patricia Velasquez, and Oliver Platt just to name a few.The new riders are quite an eyeful.  From the gorgeous Marisol to the outrageous Psymon, the new boarders offer more than just replay value, they add more personality to the game.In the last SSX, you could bump riders out of your way and have no worries of reprisal.  Well, not this time around!  If you knock down another rider, better watch you back! They will remember it.  There's an agression meter that tracks how much other riders like or dislike you.  So play nice and leave the race in one piece, or play rough and wind up off a cliff.The new courses are a breath of fresh air.  And the redesigns of the old courses range from challenging to maniacal.  If you thought that the Tokyo Megaplex was insane before, you ain't seen nothing yet!Other than the redesigned and new courses, the most dramatic change is UBER Tricks.Yes, Uber Tricks.Once you've done enough tricks that your adrenaline meter is full, you can perform an Uber Trick.  I won't try to discribe them, but I'll name a few: Proper Propeller Air, Magician Air, Guillotine Air, Torpedo Air, and Near Miss Air.Did that pique your interest?The vistas are beautiful and the gameplay is sweet.  If you liked the first SSX, then you can't live without this one.  If you never bought the first but wanted to, well, you'll want to get both now.If you want the best game to hit the market for all three console systems for Christmas 2001, buy this game!

As a big Crash fan, I could not help but love this game. Not as good as Crash Bash because it's too easy but enjoying all the way. Another Naughty Dog classic with your favorite bandicoot in it along with Dr Neo Cortex, Tiny Tiger, Coco, N. Gin, Dingodile, Polar, Pura, Ripper Roo, Papu Papu, Komodo Joe, Pinstripe, Fake Crash, Penta Penguin, and more. I can't wait until Crash Nitro Kart, the game that will be coming for the Playstation 2. Two thumbs up! Plus, it's one of the games that does not get tiring. As Dingodile would say, G'Bye!

PLAY,CREATE,SHARELittleBig Planet solo para el Playstation 3, en un juego muy divertido, parece simple pero tambien es muy desafiante, del estilo de Super Mario, LittleBigPlanet nos invita a sumergirnos en un mundo de fantasia donde la creatividad es la orden del dia. Aunque sus graficos parezcan pocos sofisticado, la belleza de los mismos se apreciaen en HD (720p) texturas, efectos, disenos, mundos, y lo mejor de todo la personalizacion del personaje principal Sackboy/sackgirl que hace que cada uno sea distinto y unico.Perfecto para toda la familia, los pequenos de la casa se divertiran y los mas grandes tambien, no solo con los niveles disponibles en en el discom sino la gran cantidad de DLC que constantemente se lanza atraves de la PlayStation Network tanto de niveles, trajes y demas que se puedan imaginar.Multiplayer: FANTASTICO, es que este juego se disfruta mas en compania (sea local o online)El Online: IMPRESIONANTE. no solo te permite jugar en linea con hasta 4 participantes mas, sino que al poder los usuarios crear "mundos" y subirlos, encontraras niveles nuevos todos los dias, de todas las tematicas, solo la imaginacion es tu limite y como dice el comercial "you never finish LittleBigPlanet", y es cierto, siempre hay retos y aventuras nuecas esperando a un click de distancia y todo de manera sencialla de obtener.LittleBigPlanet, un videojuego que no puede faltar en ninguna coleccion de Playstation 3 que se precie, no importa si eres hard core gamer u casual camer, no importa si te gustan los shooters o las plataformas, el arcade o la simulacion, es un MUST HAVE.A que esperas para tenerlo?
Un juego para toda la familia, entretenido y ademas promueve la creatividad enormemente.Quizas todo su potencial estan mas alla de las capacidades de un ni&ntilde;o de 8 o menos, sin embargo la diversion que brinda es suficiente para recomendarlo a ni&ntilde;os de esa edad.Un buena introduccion a comunidades virtuales para los menores donde no solo expresan su personalidad con atuendos y demas, sino que desarrollan la imaginacion creando mundos propios que por mas simple que sean los reconfortan al saber que pueden compartirlos.Definitivamente recomendable si se tienen ni&ntilde;os, para adultos creo que la mayor diversion se obtiene compartiendo con ellos en este Pegue&ntilde;o Gran Mundo que es LBP.
Terriffic Game!En este review no puedo decir algo nuevo de lo que ya se ha comentado sobre este juego. Historia Tremenda! (Como es costumbre en la serie) Graficos Increibles y accion frenetica desde el inicio del juego (comienza justo donde finalizo GOW II), Jefes Imponentes y con efectos sumamente logrados, de lo mejor en graficos que existe para el PS3, y la jugabilidad simple y adictiva que ha hecho de la serie GOW todo un exito en todas sus versiones. Dicho esto solo puedo recomendar el Juego, no puede faltar en cualquier coleccion que se precie de PS3.PROS:-Excelente historia (unida a la 2 entregas anteriores), forma un cierre epico de la saga.-Excelente Gameplay.-Excelentes Graficos (los efectos de luz, de lo mejor que hay en PS3).-Mucha diversion.CONS:Duracion (que no es lo mismo que durabilidad) el modo historia se puede culminar entre 9 y 12 horas, muy poco.. pero en su favor tienes que esas 12 horas seran de pura adrenalina, diversion, jefes epicos, historia trepidante..PD:Si deseas disfrutar de este juego mas aun te recomiendo que compres primeroGod of War: Collection, de verdad que no te arrepentiras, y junto con este, hacen un JUEGO EPICO!
un demo jugable lo hace uno pensar que no necesita el juego pues te puedes pasar horas y horas divirtiendote con elpero una vez sumido en el juego siempre llega la cosquilla de otros mundos, otras variaciones, etc.ya compre el juego a un excelente precio y ahora la cosquilla me da por los adds-on disponiblesmi unica queja es que uno acostumbrado a jugar "Capturando la Bandera" en el demo, como que decepciona que la mayoria de las partidas creadas por los usuarios sean de Death Match individual
Half Life 2 Episode 1, es la continuacion de Half Life 2 y mucho mas.  Me atreveria a decir que a pesar de lo corto de su duraci&oacute;n, hay mucha mas diversion de la que hay en todo HL2.Salvese quien pueda-------------------Al final de HL2 el Dr. Freeman logro detener la huida del Dr. Breen y destruyo el reactor en la cima de la citadela.  Y GMan lo puso en estasis de nuevo.  Ahora la mision es escapar de ciudad 17 junto con Alyx Vance antes que el reactor explote.  Es aqui donde los problemas empiezan.Me siento solo----------------Bueno, esta vez el Dr. Freeman no est&aacute; solo, se encuentra acompa&ntilde;ado de Alyx quien esta vez har&aacute; un poco mas que solo abrir puertas y hacer comentarios graciosos.  Ahora ambos estan juntos y deben luchar para habrirse paso atravez de una ciudad en caos.&iquest;Qu&eacute;... Ya?----------------------La accion se desarrolla sin dar respiro y afortunadamente los desafios son tan variados que cuando menos lo sientas el juego termin&oacute;. El juego es relativamente corto, unas 5 o 6 horas de juego. Sin embargo la canitidad ha sido sustituida por calidad, pues al final te sentiras satisfecho y con ganas de m&aacute;s.  A esperar el episodio 2.Calificacion:Graficas: 9Sonido: 9Control: 8Historia: 8-------------Diversion: 9

One of my favorite Xbox games along with ESPN NBABasketball 2k4. I really don't think a NFL game canget much better than this. There is nothing likeplaying a franchise mode in the NFL Madden. Youhave what seems to be unlimited create playersand it sure helps in NFL Madden. And you havethe ownership mode. Is there really any reasonto play any other mode?? You control the cap, theparking prices, food etc..... You add things tothe stadiums to help draw fans and you can evenmove the franchise(Which really isn't a good ideauntil you have played several seasons) to otherlocations to draw better crowds.The action is really good and pretty realistic. Ihaven't seen all this 30 sack nonsense that oneposter claimed. Sure the offensive line strugglesto block at times, but that's why you need good WR'sto make plays in a hurry. Also, having good TE'sseems to help. Also, to help the offensive strugglesI get a moble QB as you do sort of seem like a sittingduck with a Kerry Collins or Kurt Warner as a QB.I like that you can create a good deep playbook. Tobe honest, I'm a playaction pass type of guy. I loveto use the run to set up the pass and there is alotof plays that fits my desire. One thing that bothersme is that the computer doesn't use the running gamevery well. They often abandon in it favor of the passwhich results in alot of sacks and unbalanced passingstats.I would suggest this game to any NFL gamers and afterthis one you probably will not need to buy another NFLgame for a long time. Just too much fun with the ownermode and the spring training mode.
One of my favorite Xbox games along with ESPN NBABasketball 2k4. I really don't think a NFL game canget much better than this. There is nothing likeplaying a franchise mode in the NFL Madden. Youhave what seems to be unlimited create playersand it sure helps in NFL Madden. And you havethe ownership mode. Is there really any reasonto play any other mode??

Populous: The Beginning is a great game, and does't have any downsides. You control a tribe in their quest to promote the Shaman to God. To achieve this, you must guide the tribe through 25 levels, destroying any enemy tribes in the way. There are many types of followers: braves, firewarriors, preachers, Shamen, warriors, and spies. The Shaman is the most powerful follower; she can perform 15 spells, such as volcanos, lightning, tornados, and earthquakes, as well as four very powerful spells, Armageddon, Bloodlust, Teleport, and Ghost Army. Each spell has its own use, to guard followers, attack enemies, and other uses. There are three enemy tribes: Matak (green), Chumara (yellow), and Dakini (red). Levels can have one, two, or all three enemy tribes that you must destroy. In each level, there are Vaults of Knowledge, Stone Heads, and/or other special things to help you. Some may give you new spells, others can destroy parts of the enemy. You can also build buildings, but your braves must build them for you. All of the buildings have different uses, such as training followers to be warriors or other special followers (except the Shaman), or to reproduce new braves, to increase the size of your tribe. Overall, this game is great, and has no flaws, yet it is difficult, especially the levels toward the end, so I would recommend this game to people who have patience, lightning-fast reflexes, and intelligence to form strategies.

There are four important questions to ask yourself when playing a game. "Am I having fun?" "Are the graphics palletable?" "Does this have replay value?" & "Would you buy or rip a CD of the soundtrack?" For me, it was "Yes, yes, yes, & yes."Also try some more Sunflower games (this is a Sunflower game) like Knights of Honor & ParaWorld. There's also the Tradewinds series, Ages of Empires series, The Settlers series, Westward series, & the other two Anno games.If you enjoyed the soundtrack of the game, you might share my taste in other game soundtracks. Try American McGee's Alice, Fable, Heroes of Might & Magic 4, Maple Story, Aveyond, My Tribe, Hidden Expedition Titanic, & Plant Tycoon.

Poor, poor Alice. Your parents killed in a fire, you are now trapped in an insane asylum with only your madness to keep you company. Even your dreams of Wonderland have become corrupted by a fractured mind, old friends becoming terrifying menaces and familiar places now dank and mysterious. What was once a place of wonder now becomes a life-threatening journey into your own psychosis.Clever, wicked Alice, filled with malice, to bring all your new toys into Wonderland with you. From the simple knife (for hacking or throwing) to a lethal deck of cards to an explosive Jack-in-the-Box to the devastating Blunderbuss, the array of toys with which you defend yourself is simply delightful, in a dangerous sort of way. Your foes are many, and of a wide variety, including the brutish Card Guards, malevolent chess pieces, frightful Imps, a giant Mad Hatter, the twisted Jabberwock, and even the Red Queen herself. It's a good thing that you came to this new Wonderland prepared for some deadly play. There is much of it to be had.But, dear Alice, don't you know that all your old friends are here as well? There's the old Rabbit, of course, as obsessed as ever with his pocket watch and his tardiness. And the Caterpillar, who seems to have descended further into his own addictions. And even the dear Cheshire Cat is here, accompanying you on your journey always ready to offer his toothsome grin and a word of wry advice. Your friends may be a little more twisted, a little more frightening than before, but they're all still here. At first, anyway.This isn't the Wonderland you once knew, Alice. It has become beautiful and terrible in your absence. Once-peaceful landscapes are now frightening and treacherous, slightly maddening in their off-kilter perspective. Voices, once comforting and friendly, are now laced with a tone of threat and malice. Music, once sprightly, is strange and otherwordly. You must be constantly aware of your surroundings, as you can be suddenly attacked from almost anywhere.This is a fight for your sanity, Alice.  For your very life.  Be careful, be strong, be brave... and you may just escape this strange new Wonderland with your mind intact.

They're bacccccccccck, and badder than ever!Twisted Metal Black is without a doubt the most disturbing game in the popular series.  Each character has a dark story, and is looking for an answer, but they need to win the tournament called Twisted Metal to receive thier wishes.  Characters from previous games in in here: Sweet Tooth, Mr. Grimm, Axel, Warthog, Minion, Road Kill and a batch of new characters.  I personally like the opening to Sweet Tooth.

PS Vita Travel PouchI bought the vita travel pouch right after I got my vita to help prevent scratches when I take my vita outside or on vacation. You open the pouch with a zipper revealing a piece of fabric in the middle. It divides the case into two sections. You put the vita in one side, I put the screen facing the fabric because it softer. On the other side are two mesh pockets for accessories. On the fabric that divides the case are four slots for vita game cards. The case also has a little hook which a strap can be attached too.The case is very durable and protects the vita perfectly.
I love the original Playstation controller, the dual analog, the dual shock, dual shock 2, and dual shock 3 (I wasn't a fan of the Sixaxis only controllers).This one is the best by far! I like the better throw distance on the L2 & R2 buttons, the ridges around the edges of the thumbsticks, the speaker, touchpad, and headset connector! All of that and it's still a comfortable controller to hold!
The pouch is made out of soft material but has very good interior padding to protect your Vita (front and back).Not sure if this is of importance to anyone but my previous HORI case had a horrible stench that has contaminated my Vita - the fabric on this one smells nice and will help preserve the original new manufactured plastic of your Vita.
First off, this controller is amazing and is a huge step over the dualshock 4. It includes many new features like the share button and touch pad, but the controller itself just feels great in your hands.Pros--Very comfortable-Amazing thumb sticks-Back trigger buttons are heavily improved-Share button is a great feature-Headphone jack-Speakers to enhance experience (in a shooting game the dualshock 4 speakers have bullets speeding past you sounds)-Now has micro USB-Light bar is sweet-Good value for $60. (Xbox one's is also $60 but doesn't have touch pad, headphone jack, speakers, light bar, and a share button)Cons--no micro USB includedOverrall, the dualshock 4 is the best playstation controller yet and has an edge on Xbox's controllers.
The DUAL SHOCK 4 improves on the PS3's DUAL SHOCK 3 in every way. It has good weight, the grips are comfortable, and the trigger buttons are much improved. The mono speaker takes its functionality from the WiiMotes and the Touchpad doesn't have a ton of usage yet,The only area that the DS4 suffers is its battery life.......at about only 7 Hours....you will have to keep the USB Charging cable handy as the battery is once again not removable.

Ok, I'm going to be honest.  I LOVED the first Uncharted, and I actually bought it used, because well it was cheap, and I never really heard of it.  Well, that game was AWESOME!!  Hands down one of the best games I've played in a LONG TIME.  Second game came out, and I want it, but wanted to save money and buy it used again.  Well, I just happen to hear, that sales are not as great as they publishers hoped, so I'm calling out to all gamers who buy used games, and not buy this game used!!  BUY IT NEW!  If they make a Near Perfect game, and it doesn't sell well we got no one to blame but ourselves when we get junk games.  I got caught in the hype and bought Modern Warfare 2, and well, I still haven't beat the game, and the story line, wellll.. sucked.  It sells like hotcakes!  Not saying, it's a bad game, but all I'm saying is Uncharted 2 not only deserves  to sell a trillion games, but it earned it from all the hard work they put into it.  I'm BUYING new tomorrow, and I hope that other people will too.  Pass this one if you want, but seriously, don't you want more great games like this??Update.... Guess the game is about to hit 3 million!!! Guess they are getting those sales a little later.  This GAME IS AWESOME.  I've play it over and over again.  The online mode is also very good!  I can't tell you how much you feel like your playing a movie.  The voice acting, and animation is very realistic.  If you own a PS3 you need to own this in your library.
Unless I am missing something, the only thing I don't like right now is that you can't drop out of the game and go back to the main remake menu to pick between the 3 games. You load the game, get a menu to pick 1 of the 3 games, and then you have to quit the game with the PS3 menu and reload the whole game to play a different one. Overall that isn't a huge deal and you won't be jumping between games often. But I like to play number 1 for a while, then #2, and then #3. So that I am not playing any of them for a really long time at once.The HD looks good. I loaded up my PS2 versions and it's definitely sharper. If you enjoyed the PS2 versions, then I highly recommend this remake bundle as it is definitely sharper in HD, is a great value over finding and buying all 3 in PS2 format. And required if you don't have an older PS3 that plays PS2 games.If you are looking to get this game and haven't played the PS2 versions, you may be disappointed because it's still a PS2 quality game and you may find it lacking as a modern game. Though I think it still stands up even now. I have certainly played worse games that are native PS3 generation games.UPDATE: Please leave a comment if you don't find my reviews helpful. Tell me why you think it is not helpful to you and I will try to answer your concerns. What are you looking for from this review.
I like to start by saying i don't review many things on amazon unless i have major issues that i feel need to told to others or if i truely love the product. In this case it's the latter!I originally borrowed the first DeadSpace from a friend, and after several attemps at playing i just couldn't get into it. Mainly due to little things that irratated me. So after a while i just gave up, and put it down to just not being the right game for me. Then a few weeks ago while trading in some old games at GAME store i STOPped at!! I saw a preowned copy of DeadSpace2. With some extra credit and not a whole lot of anything to choose from i figured i'd buy it and just return it in 7 days. With that thought firmly in mind i bought the 360 copy. Then that evening after i put the kids to bed, i popped on my headset, turned down the lights and figured here we go.To my amazement all the little things i found frustrating had gone away, and after a while 1 hour became 2 hours, 2 became 3.... At first i was irratated that my plan to try this game out and return it in 7 days, was looking like it might not happened. So night after night i played, and each time i found myself getting more hooked. 6 days passed and i was off to pick up Bulletstorm, and my plan had been to return DeadSpace2 for full credit. But i just couldn't bring myself to do it.So instead i kept it, and i didn't even want to unwrap the newly bought Bulletstorm (which is a good game, but at the time i wasn't interested).This game is truely fantastic. I feel like i'm playing a game that immerses me into it. Like i'm in Alien or something!It didn't even matter that i did't played the first one, as this one has a video you can watch that brings you upto speed on the story. I play this game every chance i can get. Which is generally at night, which definately adds to the scary ambients.After a while i realised this is one of the best games i've played in a while, and i never would have thought it. I'll definately be playing this game for some time to come. And will keep it for a long time.....at least untill DeadSpace3 perhaps!!Buy this game if you truely want a fully immersive, scary, and some times bowel moving (LOL) experience that'll leave you wanting more!
Well, I'm a little late as this game has been out for some time now.  So long in fact that you can't even buy the XBox version from Amazon itself, but from others in the Amazon Marketplace (new, used), which is what I did.  I was a little skittish at first to order it in this way, but it worked out very well.  In fact, I may have recieved it sooner than if I had been able to purchase it from Amazon.  The person must have shipped it the very same day.The graphics are really good for an Xbox title.  I also played the PC demo, so I know the graphics on the PC are much better.  One of the problems with having an XBox version is you can't play "Episode 2".  You also can't play multiplayer, it isn't even an option.  I thought it odd it had no multiplayer, then I read in another review that the PC version DOES have multiplayer.A few problems I had with this game were minor.  I'm not sure if it's the XBox controls, or just the game, but I would have trouble many times trying to do something as simple as get through a door.  I'd just get kind of get hung up for no reason that I could see (no clutter around me).  There was a lot of clutter in the game.  Not so much a bad thing, but sometimes it could make a simple task of walking hard as there was always stuff laying around.I also noticed some slow points as the XBox had trouble keeping up with the action.  This isn't a game issue.  In fact, I have a first gen XBox.  You may find a later generation works a little better.There are two driving levels.  I found them to be a pain.  The controls for the vehicles are not very good.  And, they just seem to go forever.  It may have been better if they split them up a bit.  They went on so long I found myself getting dizzy and had to take a break.Some aspects of the game were just amazing.  As much as I'd like to tell you about them, I don't want to spoil anything.  I know I didn't expect them, and it gave me a "WOW!" moment more than once.This isn't a straight up shooter like the Halo  series.  In many places you have to figure out how to get to the next area.  This can be frustrating.  I found myself in a room for about 15 minutes as I swam to the same places I had been to many times trying to figure out what the heck I missed.  And, it's always something really simple that makes you slap yourself on the head.One really nice thing about this game is the length.  I'm not sure how long it took me to beat it, but it was quite a few hours.  This is nice when you think of other games that only have about 7 to 10 hours of gameplay.  It really makes it feel like you got your moneys worth, even if it did only cost 12 bucks...lol
don't get me wrong or anything, this game is great, but i think the camera moved a little too much. i was however displeased with the first-person view, i think this should be an option, 3rd or 1st person view. i played the game for about 45 minutes and i started to get dizzy and nausea set in.today i traded the game in because i wasn't going to play this knowing i would get sick. i took the game to gamestop and got a good trade-in value.sorry, i didn't get that far, i completed two missions and had to stop. but i gaurantee you'll love the gameplay. some people don't get sensitive to certain movements, but i do. i was so excited to get this game, i hated to trade it.i recommend this game to all serious video gamers.ps. (be forewarned) the guy at gamestop said he and alot of people get motion sick playing this game.i would say rent it first if you know you get motion sick.

This expansion was a lot of fun to play. Nowadays, you can buy it (used) for a few bucks, so the price is right; originally, it was overpriced given the (short) length of game play. Like the original, the graphics are good, the sound effects well done, and the controls are easy to use. It's a quality WWII shooter WITHOUT the blood/gore and foul language that most modern games include. I played single player only. 2.40 is the latest patch for the game. The game runs fine on Windows XP Home SP3. It's a game that I plan to replay in the future.This expansion covers...* the Battle of the Kasserine Pass* the fall of Bizerte* the Battle of Monte Cassino* the amphibious landings and defense of the beachhead at Anzio* the battle of Monte BattagliaInstead of buying this version of the game, I recommend buyingMedal of Honor 10th Anniversary Bundle - PC, which includes:1) Allied Assault2) Spearhead Expansion Pack3) Breakthrough Expansion Pack4) Pacific Assault Director's Edition5) AirborneVisit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections

My jaws sunk low, self-emitting air filed around me, and stupidly I gawked at my PC screen. Since when did a game rekindle my fancy for the first form of literature I warmly embraced? Anime, at times, is juiced up with vague or unnecessary talk with global weight on crushing action, but comic books have grown as a nippy alternative to time-consuming novels with marvelously penciled scenes. Where comics like the dormant Battle Chasers and, all-time favorite, Spawn attenuated my reading and visual proclivity, Freedom Force successfully lands on the video game populace in style. Full of tantalization, the game rips a new outfit on the grounds of gaming. I haven't experienced this kind of cunning direction, ever. Irrational Games assembles a flat-out ambiance which thrusts players into thrilling heroism. The RPG/Strategy affiliation shreds awesome gameplay components. Every description in the game is an indication that the company was rapt on fashioning a game based on the comic book medium. Freedom Force takes in all the legacy and stereotypes of the 60's Silver Age, and on the videogame scale, it rumbles.Sweaty-palm action awaits as soon as you decide who to take from a pool of heroes. After selecting four members, you then jump onto the fray and gain following missions. More often than not, your elite band of defenders must put an end to rampaging supervillains along with their loyal minions. Reasonably linear, the lion's share of Freedom Force is the mastered mechanics, and the ironic yet interesting cost of being violent superheroes. Remember anime (or even Power Puff Girls) where the forces of good take it on the open streets, disregarding the safety of structures, and bulldoze it down? As Uncle Ben once said from Spidey comics, "with great power comes even greater responsibility." Ditto, here. Pedestrians mind their walks of life, cars burn rubber, and in the center, a heated clash between the forces of good and evil. Oh, dear! Oh, my! Being reckless may trigger unwanted wreckage of the city that is supposedly under your protection. Depending on your choice of attacks, Patriot City can be decimated to rubble. Strategic usage of the environment (i.e. lifting cars as projectiles) should be limited due to the sensitivity of the backgrounds. From caving buildings to impersonating Babe Ruth with traffic polls, needless destruction is booed.Devilish destruction reduces the bag of important Prestige Points. Awarded after victory, these points are applied to attain additional heroes. EXP points are also given to prime a hero's abilities or expand them. As an incentive to minimize running amok, if you fail to wisely handpick a fit squad, future supervillains will squash your band of heroes into [mush]. Ample with whirls of Real-Time frenzy, a tide of excellent RPG elements, and the aim to prevent harm on Patriot city, Freedom Force is smart as it is witty.Totally smitten with Freedom Force, it hurts to divulge the minimal frowns upon it. In fact, the game gets terribly hectic without any sign of slowing down. Selecting commands may provide golden opportunities for curt surprises from concealed enemies. Failing to detect them means your good guys go down and dead. Without radar or even a teeny map, studying your surroundings seems like a tactical joy, but the constant, overbearing work is strain for the eyes. Trust me, if you thought 4 heroes is depressing petty, it's enough with the brutal and lighting-quick square offs. Also, no automatic pausing is a pain. Frequent instances of tongue-lashing conforms with the in-game chaos. Even so, the robust personality of Freedom Force dwarfs the potholes floating around it. However, far from perfect, there is nothing quite like this and is the closest thing to match a child's interactive role in a comic book.The hero cast is intentionally cheesy as the Super Friends. Stereotypes of the 60's comics (corny dialogue) forges together and packs a full press of eccentricity. Merciless creatures alternatively keep the 90's evil-doer persona unbroken. Expect the trademark of what Marvel Comics originally gave rise to. Where DC presented the typical "superhero stops supervillain," Marvel effectively introduced a new prospective and presented the personal life of its characters. Freedom Force excels on it too. Character growth was nice to witness, but the cast is so overpopulated that various characters are overshadowed by the stars. Cheesy hallmarks and naturally droll, the clowning occasions in Freedom Force deserves recognition.Voice-overs are gallant, funny, and when called for, somber. Excellent themes manage to merge an exclusive fusion of topnotch sound quality while comic-looking graphics that are so colorfully caustic it'll have your gums bleed. Once a "FOOSH," slashed across the screen, I was tickled by my comic book sensibilities. Characters are fleshed out with exaggerated, superhero costumes and work well with the polygonal construction. The interactive 3D environment and superhero powers are very cool to watch when toyed with. The option to tailor the camera view is welcomed, especially when seconds of disorder surface. The thick quality behind every inch of comic book design has me fighting back tears."Sniff, it's beautiful man. Just beautiful."Vast in the digit of powers and tactics, the single-player is an experience of immersive frolic. Many people responded with a confounded, "huh," when I asked if they knew the existence of Freedom Force. Can anyone say, "sleeper hit." Hallmarks of the game siphons reality, and lets the boyish imaginings to roam free and putter with the infectious bounties of the game. Logging hours on the extensive single-player, the chance to shape your own characters, appearance, powers, and pick out an assortment of Marvel and DC skins, will have you brewing cup after cup of coffee. Now, to shut these blood-shot eyes. . .

Every one, let's all slap our heads and exclaim &quot;D'oh! Why didn't anyone think of this before?&quot; This is the game all of us fanboy geeks have been waiting for! A game that pays serious homage to 60's comic book characters! Each unique character is so authentic to the time period, you'd swear they were actually from a comic book. Each new character has a comic-style &quot;origin of&quot; cinema cutscene. Every level is designed like a comic book with authentic &quot;biffs&quot; and &quot;pows&quot; as you beat up Commies and other 60's scum. The game is wildly entertaining, even if you don't like comic books.

FREEDOM FORCE hands down is one of the most wonderful games ever to hit the shelves.  Combining the action and over-the-top adventure of the comic book with real-time strategy gameplay as well as an RPG, this PC game transports the player to another world and another time.  Good and evil are painted in black and white.  Nefarious villains abound in Patriot City, given amazing powers by the arrival of Energy X.  However, as with any true comicbook plot, the same mysterious power that creates supervillains also creates and calls forth the superheroes that challenge those villains.Crafted by Irrational Games, FREEDOM FORCE is the first true RPG that features superheroes and dastardly villains (complete with ringing challenges, threats, and pundits).  Over the years, gamers have been promised such a venue but no one has ever been able to deliver.  (Maybe the work of some unknown super-villain!?)  Irrational Games also created the award-winning System Shock 2, the science-fiction based RPG, and the up-coming horror RPG, The Lost.  All of the company's work so far has been in the RPG PC field, but efforts are being made to shift over into console gaming.  Irrational Games has brought together creative talent that have been responsible for games such as:  Thief: the Dark Project, Ultima Underworld, and System Shock.One of the most appealing aspects of FREEDOM FORCE is the absolute ease of entering the gameplay.  Even players unseasoned in the ways of RPGs and tactical strategy games can step into the world of Patriot City and begin battling supervillains and common crooks.  Tips range throughout the early levels, allowing those new to the game playing system to learn how to use their powers as well as the best strategies to use against enemies.  Aside from the gameplay, the sheer world of superheroes, super-villains, and Patriot City comes to life in the same bright colors of a comicbook.  Minute Man's heroic speeches, Mentor's alien origin, and the pathos of Man-Bot--trapped in an armored shell--show influences from Jack Kirby and Stan Lee's creations at Marvel Comics.  The cut-scenes that show those origins, as well as additional story materials, are absolutely the bomb.  Maybe the gamer has just blasted, battled, and broken their way through enemy ranks, but the sense of wonder in this story-telling format is mesmerizing.  The gamer feels as though he or she has somehow stepped into the all-in-color-for-a-dime pages of the traditional superhero comicbook.  Maybe the gamer can lose the battles, but he or she knows in the end that victory will go to the hero if the proper strategies, powers, and teamwork are utilized.  To add to the whole experience, a character-generator is built into the game, and downloading from various websites already in existence (or a little creative tinkering), can bring any hero a player has seen in heroic media or can imagine into his or her campaign as a force for good.The FREEDOM FORCE package is put together extremely well, and there are a couple of things that would have been nice to see.  1)  a full-color map of Patriot City and the surrounding environs just for coolness effect.  2)  the ability to switch off the tips when starting a new campaign because they can be distracting.  3)  secondary prestige points on ALL missions, which would have only necessitated a little tweaking.Overall, FREEDOM FORCE is an excellent addition to any gamer's collection, or for the comic fan that wants to play in the world that he or she has only dreamed about.  Needing a gift for the young, budding superhero hanging upside down in the closet at home?  FREEDOM FORCE's gameplay system can easily be learned by even the little guys, although some of the solutions may need parental involvement.  But hey, every hero needs a sidekick even if it is Mom or Dad.  So grab a towel and knot it around your neck, then sit down to discover what superpowers you've gotten from Energy X and go out to battle Evil.  The neighbors will never know, because you have a Secret Identity.

Of many of the strategy games I've played as a gamer this most definatly my favorite.  This game relies less on resource managment and more on strait out action and combat.  There are 3 different campaigns for each nationality (China which relies on nubmers, USA which relies on its more powerful vehicles and GLA which relies on its versitility although its the weakest of the 3 in my opinion.)  Although I have yet to beat teh campain most of the fun is in the skirmishs taking on computer paleyrs, while initially it may be hard, once you grow accustmed to the way teh enemy's play you can easily beat them.  This makes the game seem almost too easy, although I can't quite beat a hard enemy right now but this is  the first I've played in awhile and I'm once again regaining my strategy, but I'm faily certain at one point I could beat teh ardest enemy difficutly with ease.  What does all this mean? It means for a good challenge you'll eventually have to resort to online play leaving people on 56k to easily be left in teh dark (while I use broadband now I remember almost everything lagged in 56k.)Very highly recomned for trs fans seeking fast paced action.

My girl picked this as a game we can play together on my Sony II.  Well she is 5 so I do most of the playing.Basically, you get to rotate between Spongebob, Patrick and Plankton through a rather strange adventure.Diesel Dreaming: You start off as Spongebob in the middle of a dream of being a racer.  His bed turns into a car and he gets a crazed crazed game face and then you race.  The racing is ok, I ran it full out the whole time.  You come close to finish but you stop your car just before the finish line and somebody comes by and destroys your car.  Enter the next phase, Spongebob must get his license which runs away from him.  Another race, with Patrick.  Patrick  has a habit of leaving explosives which slow you down.  Again the same near finish with plankton running you over.  Then you must go collect parts to fix your car.  After that a race with Plankton which has a near finish with Gary running you over.  There is another quest to obtain turbo parts for the final race with Gary.  This time you finish but you end up going over a cliff.Overall the racing is easy as mentioned I ran it full out and didn't really need the turbo boost.  There are turbo boost strips and things to dodge all through the races.  Practice as you will need it later.  One thing that is odd is the fact you really aren't racing your opponents as you really never catch them(well I didn't).Starfish man  The Girth of a Hero!  This time you play Patrick as he is Starfishman.  You get calls from a stranger as he guides you through the battle with dreaded Patrick.  The scenes are comic book form and overall it's kind of fun.  Patrick changes outfits every time he fights.  My girl likes it when he is idle and Patrick will grab his belly and wiggle it.  Practice jumping as it will help if you get accurate with it later on.Who Ordered the Super-Size Patty?Now you play Plankton; who as usual has a scheme to enlarge a krabby Patty piece to get the formula.  Unfortunately, he makes it too big and it threatens to attack him.  He enlarges himself but only enough to be as tall as everybody else.  The patty attacks and you spend your time running from it with the help of a freeze ray.  There are short games where you hide in a trash can and collect stuff as it falls.  You have to be careful as the patty sleeps, wakes up and turns around.  You can jump for pieces to get them early or stuff that flies by horizontal.Alaskan Belly TroubleOr as my girl says, the elastic bull worm.  We return to Spongbob as he awakes to find himself falling.  You do some free falling and dodge things and collect coins.  Eventually, you get eating by the worm.  You crash and find Old Man Jenkins who asks you to find stuff to fix a plane.  In return he will fly you out.  The quests are to find the Ironing board wife for the chief.  Three powercell jelly fish for the ineventor and sorting junk for the remaining parts.  Finally, you have to free a blocked chili can which is causing the stomach problems for the worm.  There is jumping fighting and slaping back spit shots from some worm/plant like creatures.  Overall it's a fun episode which is my daughters favorite.Rocket RodeoStarfishman returns as he is flying through space on the rocket.  He has to doge debris and flys into a black hole.  He ends up in a space station where he has to save the crew from asteroids.  He leaves the station and then goes about fighting a UFO crabby patty which is destroyed by shooting weak spots.Revenge of the Giant Plankton MonsterPlankton is back and thinks he was dreaming only to find the patty sleeping next to him.  This time he turns himself into a giant and chases the patty.  It's a fun a game of the monster destroying the town genra.Rooftop rumble:Spongebob and old man Jenkins return as they fly their plane.  Running from plankton (to lure him away from town), dodging things thrown by him and shooting supports to make things drop on him.  Starfishman returns and sets about trying to shrink him back down.  Note:  when plankton starts throwing cars at patrick, there is a ledge you can hide under and not be touched.Hypnotic HighwayThe final part of the game.  This for some reason was hard for me.  It is a race between Spongebob, Plankton and Patrick.  I was able to finish it by taking different routes.  Speed, dodging obstacles and making time bonus points are essential.  I also didn't bother trying to collect coins.Once you complete the race, you will get the end sequence.Overall I liked the game and have played it many times.  Somethings to consider.  There are coins all through the game, pick them up as they have a unique approach to buying the extras.  You have Spongebob pull a lever to get art, music, cheat codes and extra games.There are also plankton and patrick seeds to open up other things but I haven't been able to get them all yet.

I know this is a game that came out before the World Cup, but don't think it came out after the World Cup, Hwang Sun Hong is the only star player for Korea, Woon Jae Lee has only a rating of 64, the bets players are Hwang Sun Hong 80, Kim Byung Ji 80, Ki -Hyeon Seol79, Chun Soo Lee 78, and Jin Cheul Choi 76.  Only official Korean chant is Ee-ku-ra, which means win, but thats it, no Taehanminguk, O Korea, and etc.  For you Fifa fans, they have up to 42 teams not ounting All American, All Asia, All Europe and etc.  They go as far as to Senegal!  The game also is way too easy, if you try to win you score too much, if you try to keep the score fairly close like 1 to 0 you give up too many goals and your palyers are too tired, save your money and get Fifa 2003

Why compare this game to Mozart? They are the same:  Genius in Simplicity.I loved this game.  I am actually surprised that even more people have not played it.  It has the highest rating ever from PC Gamer (98%).  Think about that:  Alpha Centauri is 2% away from being considered The Perfect Game.Why? Strategy that is detailed but intuitive.  Diplomacy that is believable and matters.  Game balance.  A fun storyline.  An intelligent AI that does not have to cheat to win.But by far my favorite part of the game is the technology aspect of the game.  Each new future technology (some truly vague) is introduced with a sound byte from a faction leader, but more important is WHAT these leaders say. Philosophy, religion, literature, hard science, Emmanuel Kant, Aristotle, even Military Cadences are used to provide atmosphere to the game.  This is a game that respects the gameplayer's intelligence.  Additionally, the future technology tree has been well researched.  Just go to the back of the well-produced Alpha Centuari manual to see the vast bibliography of Science Textbooks, Hard Science Fiction (Think Stanley Kubrik's 2001) and Soft Science Fiction (Think Star Wars or Star Trek) that the game draws influence from.  I have a PhD in Molecular biology, and I must endorse the technology tree as an excellent model for speculating how humanity's future knowledge-base may be represented. Particularly interesting is how different civilizations are based on faction instead of nationality.  However, nationalistic stereotypes are represented.  The communist/socialist faction is represented by Chairman Yang (Chinese).  The Gaia mentality is represetned by Lady Dierdre Skye (Celtic/Irish).  The University faction is represented by a Russian Scientist (Academician Prokhor Zakharov), and the UN peacekeeping faction by a Ghandi-like figure in Commissioner Pravin Lal.  There are others, to be sure, but these are the most egregious.Regardless, the game is an outstanding mix of fun, a stytle of gameplay that does not require excessive detail to be considered intelligent, great presentation values, and an overall attention to polish even in the smallest details.  There is precious little that could be changed in this game.  To quote Salieri describing Mozart's music, &quot;Displace one note and there would be diminishment. Displace one phrase, and the structure would fall.&quot;

How anybody could complain about the graphics,backgroundor foreground,is beyond me.You people must be hooked upto some ancient t.v.'s.These are some of the best graphicsIve seen yet.In fact,this game has redeemed EA,in my eyes.So smooth and the colors are sharp with great resolution.They definitely did it right for XBOX owners this time,muchbetter than NEED FOR SPEED2.When I unlocked Black Cove andthe Scottish Highlands,my brain was assaulted and promptly exploded!Unreal sweeping vistas over looking the ocean and blood redand azure blue skies in sharp detail.Play this game when you'remad,and disaster is sure to follow.Play it with the right attitude and you will pull off some amazing victories,no matterhow tough the A.I. is.This is the best golf game ever made andI don't see how they'll ever top it.A must have.Rent it and Igaurantee you'll be headed up to the store.

I have to go with ESPN this year for baseketball, by a smidgen. This game is basically average in every aspect. The graphics are average, the gameplay is average and the player rating system is just horrible. The real reason I ever play this game is for the slam dunk contest. It is a lot of fun and it is very addicting. The three point contest is a lot of fun too. I'd say this game is worth renting and now that the price has been lowered maybe buying, for the all star weekend mode alone. Here is how I rate this game.graphics: 75Player Rating system: 40gameplay: 70Dunk contest: 100three point contest: 95rookie challenge: 80commentary: 85freestyle control: 90overall: 85Espn barely beats it this year.

This game is Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 by EA Sports. It has many different options. It is much better then the other golf game i had Tiger Wooda PGA Tour 2002 (see my review). When you enter the main menu you have to pass three parts of a tutorial. Then you can start playing. You know how you could take advantage in early games and spin the ball directly to the hole? Well, early in the game, you go through tour difficulty and can't spin the ball any more. Gameface is back and better than ever. Golfers include Adam Scott, Tiger Woods, Sunday Tiger Woods, Ricky Barnes, Natlie Gulbis , # 1 golfer in the world Vijay singh, and Stuart Appleby. Courses include Couer D' Alene, Coloniel CC (the course where Annoka Sourenstam missed the cut at in a PGA Tour event), Pebble Beach, St. Andrews, and TPC at Sawgrass. Announcing includes Gary McCord. Also in this game are l;egens such as Arnold Palmer, Seve Balleseros, Gary Player, and Ben Hogan. This game is rated E for everyone. My favorite mode is matchplay, when you win a hole you can take away any of your opponent's clubs (except for the putter) or bring back one of your clubs that was taken away from you. Aother modes are stableford scoring system tournament, better ball  alternate shot, and four somes. Four problems though. There is no Phil Mickelson. No Ernie Els. No Whistling Straits (home of the 2004 U.S open). Finally, no president's cup. There is new Tiger Vision which during a round of golf when you reach the green, you get three looks at putts no matter where they are. This means you are garenteed to make the putt. Have fun and enjoy gaming.

Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2005 is a nice follow-up to the 2004 version.  For those of you who are unfamiliar with the title, here is a brief summary:Create your own golfer and take him from the ranks of the amateurs to the PGA tour, or play as one of several PGA Tour personalities included in the game, including up-and-coming youngsters Adam Scott, Charles Howell III, battle-hardened veterans like Colin Montgomery and Jesper Parnevik, multiple major winners Vijay Singh and Retief Goosen, LPGA hottie Natalie Gulbis, friend of Tiger Notah Begay III, and the man himself, Tiger Woods.  Play on close to a dozen real courses (Pebble Beach, TPC at Sawgrass, Harbortown, etc.) and two fantasy courses.Here's where 2005 improves on 2004:1.  More licensed equipment and clothing2.  More detailed character construction ("Game Face")3.  Sharper graphics4.  Legends Tour, where one can climb the ranks to challenge all-time studs Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, Ben Hogan, and Gary Player, as well as Seve Ballesteros and new legend Tiger Woods.Here's where 2004 is better:1.  More well-known courses (Plantation course at Kapalua, Princeville, Poppy Hills, Spyglass, Sahalee, Coeur d'Alene, Bethpage Black, TPC at Avenel, etc.).2.  Driving range for practice.3.  Less-buggy.I found one particularly irritating bug -When I was playing against any legend on any course that was comprised of a compilation of holes from the included courses, there was one hole from St. Andrews (Old Course) in which the computer player would tee off on the par 4 with a lob wedge!  Then, they'd putt about 20 feet.  So, basically, I would tee off, hit the ball 275+ yards, and pretty much be up a stroke right off the bat.Another irritating bug -The commentary doesn't match the situation or outcome.  For example, I'll hit an approach shot from 200+ yards away to within 8 feet of the cup, and David Feherety's voice will say something like, "That's not the worst shot in the world, but its not the best, either."  Or, you could make a putt, and he'd say, "That's going to be way short," right when the ball drops into the cup.  There are other silly mismatched comments, too.The game ran well on my terrible MSI GeForce FX 5600XT 128MB video card, but I did run into a little lag from time to time.  I upgraded to an ATI Radeon 9800 Pro, and I can pretty much play the game at the highest quality levels now.  I also tried the game on my same computer (P4 2.8c, 1 Gig of Corsair XMS RAM) with an ATI Radeon 9550 card, and it ran extremely well.  Both Radeon cards were big time upgrades over the GeForce FX 5600XT.Although 2005's courses aren't as great as 2004's, you can load 2004's courses into 2005, although they won't be available for tournament play, but you can still play matches on them.  Check out any of the Tiger Woods PGA Tour forums online for more information on how to play 2004 courses in the 2005 game.This is a really fun golf game with terrific graphics.  I found the improved graphics, better "game face," and more licensed equipment a worthwhile reason for purchasing TW2005 even though I also own TW2004.  I really don't think there is any other golf game out there that can match TW2005.  MAKE SURE you have a PC and Video Card that MORE than meets the minimum requirements if you want to see graphics that will make you drool.  I've seen what TW2004 looked like on a PC with only 16MB of Video RAM (the minimum system requirements) and a P4 2.0Ghz, and it wasn't pretty!

Real-life golfers and folks that don't play golf in real life will enjoy Tiger Woods PGA Tour '07. But if you are a golfer and you are at all familiar with the players and the 12 courses offered in this game, you will find this game most enjoyable.The courses/players are modeled after the real things, and they are indeed designed to play just like them too. You get Pinehurst, Turnberry, Carnoustie, TPC at Sawgrass, Pebble Beach, Firestone, Glen Abbey, The Prince Course, Spyglass Hill, Riviera, Bandon Dunes & St. Andrews...or you can tell the game to choose a random 18 (or 9).You can choose to play as some popular golfers that all look like perfectly created CGI versions of the real players [with the exception of Colin Montgomerie who looks more like a scary character out of the other game that I'm currently fascinated with, Resident Evil 4 (PS2 format)]. But the best and most fun way to play is creating your own golfer that you save; then improve your skills through the driving range, practice games and challenge matches.Besides stroke, match and skins play, there are several other game modes to try (which, frankly, I have not done yet).It is vital that you play in the aforementioned three modes prior to joining the PGA Tour which is, just like the real thing, a series of Thursday through Sunday four day events (you don't really have to play them on Thursday through Sunday).Completing practice games and events rewards you with improved skills and cash to spend in the pro shop on items that also help improve your skills.David Feherty and Gary McCord (the popular PGA TV announcers) narrate your game play during matches. And their commentary can be colorful at times (annoyingly so especially when you hit a bad shot).I chose to work on my approach shot and putting at first as opposed to power. It has reaped big rewards. By doing that, in the Tiger Challenge mode, I'm already finishing rounds under par and kicking the butts of the likes of Vijay Singh, Retief Goosen and the one and only Tiger Woods.  (Then I put down the SIXAXIS, see my actual clubs in the corner and think about the countless rounds of real golf in my future where just breaking 100 is a banner day.)Up to 4 people can play at a time (my 5 year old crushed me yesterday; he played as Tiger; I played as me), and online play is an option (which I have not done).After beating all of the golfers in the Tiger Challenge mode, your skill should be sharp enough to now play on the Tour in the Event Calendar mode; I'd highly recommend not joining the tour until you acquire the full potential of your skills by defeating golfers in the Tiger Challenge (and at the range).Tiger Woods PGA Tour '07 on the PS3 can kill an hour quick if you've got one to spare. Fastest 18 I've ever played. When you're playing with more than one person, set aside a good amount of time if you go a full 18 holes.Overall, this is a terrific game that is addictive as you are driven to improve your custom golfer's skills. It's great fun for the whole family. Add it to you cart.Be the ball.Update: August 28, 2007....The '08 version releases today at more than double the price of the '07 version (as of this writing). A few courses have been added to the '08 version as well as some AI enhancements. But the '07 version at half the price (before it's discontinued and out of stock) is a no-brainer.

Before I go any further I just want to state that my son is the one who plays this game, I do occasionally play the game at his instance.Anyways, my son (Age 13) had recieved this game from a friend who at the time did not own a PC with the correct graphics card to play it. So he gave it to my son since he knew that his PC's were very capable of playing this game and he has been playing it to death ever since. He primarily plays the game on-line against other players in campaign mode and loves the variety of maps, choice of weapons, and different vehicles (including helicopters and Jet Airplanes). The Graphics for this game is still very good and looks great on a ATI 4000 series or higher Video Card, Ok granted it's not going to look like or hold a torch to Battlefield 3's graphics but for a 7 year old game it still looks good.He so loves this game so much he brought a copy of the game for his laptop and got his sister (Age 9) hooked on the game so she ended up buying the Game for herself and put it on her laptop. Now he has LAN partys with his friends and family at the house.FOR WINDOWS VISTA and 7 users PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING !!!

Just hit the "OK" or "Ignore" buttons until it gets through the installation. It will then start querying the EA Battlefield 2 servers for the upgrade patches for the game and let you know when to install. THis may take serval minutes in between each patch so be patient and most importantly DO NOT EXIT THE INSTALL Windows. The entire process may take up to 60 to 90 minutes to complete. When completed it will indicate installtion complete and you should be able to start the game and start playing.The minimum system requirements are as follows for your PC Rig...CPU: Intel Pentium 4 or Celeron D CPU 1.7 GHz along with AMD Athlon XP or Sempron EquivilantRAM: 512 MB (Windows XP) 1GB (Windows Vista or Windows 7)Harddrive: 2.3 GB hard disk space (Probably 3GB needed after patching)Videocard: Radeon 8500 or GeForce FX 5700 DirectX compatible 128 MB graphics card or higher (Intergrated Intel Graphics Cards are NOT Supported by this game)Operating Systems: Windows XP (32 and 64 bit), Windows Vista (32 or 64 bit)*, Windows 7 (32 or 64 bit)** For Windows Vista and Windows 7 all applicable patches must be downloaded and applied first for Battlefield 2 to work on these two operating systems, In it's "Out of the box" state it will only work with Windows XP (32 Bit).So far I have only installed it on 32 Bit versions of Windows 7 however I will update this when I get ready to install this on my son's new 64 bit desktop (This is primarlily being done so he can play the new Battlefield 3).**** Updated 11/14/2011 - Just got thru loading this on my son's new desktop running Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 (64 Bit), did not have one problem with the install or running the game afterwards.Here are the Specs of the PC's Me and my son have loaded on so far with success...System Specs: My Sons DesktopIntel Core Dou 2 Quad socket 775, 6mb cache processorIntel DP43TF MOBO8GB of DDR2 800mhz PC6400 RAM750W Antec PSU750GB SATA HDD24bit 5.1 Creative Sound Card1GB intergrated Intel NICATI Radeon HD 6450 PCI-E 1GBWindows 7 Ultimate SP1 (64 Bit)27inch LCD VE276Q ASUS Monitor.System Specs: My Daughter's DesktopP4 3.4GHZ HT socket 478, 1 MB cache processorINTEL 865 PERLK MOBO4GB of DDR1 400mhz PC3200 RAM680W PSU300GB SATA HDD24bit 5.1 Creative Sound CardEdimax Wi-Fi Card1GB intergrated Intel NICATI Radeon HD 3850 AGP 512mbWindows 7 Ultimate SP1 (32 Bit)System Specs: My Son's LaptopDell Inspiron 1720Intel Centrino Core Duo 2 2.4 ghz processor4GB DDR2 Laptop Memory256 mb NVidia 8600m Video Card500GB Boot Drive/ 80GB Data DriveDVD/CD Burner100mb Intergrated Broadcom Nic54mbs Intel WiFi Card17 inch LCD ScreenWindows 7 Professional SP1 (32 Bit)System Specs: My Daughters LaptopDell Inspiron 1545I3 Core 2.53 ghz processor512MB ATI 4650 Video Card4 GB Of DDR3 RAM PC 10666320GB Hard Drive100mb intergrated NIC15.6 inch LCD WidescreenDVD/CD Burner54mbs Intel WiFi CardWindows 7 Professional SP1 (32 Bit)System Specs: My Sons Friends DesktopHP DC 7800 Minitower WorkstationIntel Core Duo 2 Dual Core 2.33ghz processor4 GB DDR2 667mhz PC 5300 RAM256MB Nvidia Quadro FX 1500 Video Card1GB intergrated NIC320GB Hard Drive54mbs USB Wifi CardWindows 7 Professional SP1 (32 Bit)
This is a good game and the graphics are pretty good.  In order to run this game on Windows XP Home Edition, you will need to run this in Windows Compatibility Mode (I got this to run in Windows 2000 compatibility mode).  Trying to run this game Windows XP results in a &quot;Lock-up&quot; of the PC. The Windows 95/98 gave an enumeration error and Windows NT 4.0 wouldn't run at all.  We have an older Joystick that is connected to the PC using a Serial to USB converters (USB Nest).  The joystick had to be disconnected from the PC in order to get Madden NFL 2001 to run. A joystick that has a USB connector will work without any problems.

Long ago in ancient Greece where gods, sorcery and demons roamed there lived an ex-sparta named Kratos (Voiced by TC Carson) who was a living breathing slaughterhouse that made a deal with the god of war known as Ares (Voiced by Steve Blum) who made him slaughter his own wife and daughter thus he forever barred ashes on his skin from them magically forever. Now the time has came as the other gods like Zeus (voiced by Paul Eigin) are furious about what Ares is doing in Athens causing destruction and mayhem as they sent out Kratos to find Pandora's box in a way to destroy him as he must face other enemies on his way.co-starring the voices of Linda Hunt as the narrator and Rob Paulsen, this is the ultimate Playstation 2 adventure ever conceived. This brilliant mix of fantasy, slash-and-hack and action-adventure is a great combo for this game and has been a groundbreaker since 2005 when it debuted on the PS2. The game has originally in the gameplay and the story is obviously influenced by Greek mythology as if this was influenced by 1981's classic "Clash of the Titans" but with a fresh approach.  There are challenges that you must solve that aren't too hard at times and the visuals on the game characters are just incredible. There is some brief nudity and tons of graphic gory violence like ripping harpies apart with your blades as it's no kids game, there are other weapons you can use especially magic and tons of surpises. A must play game for any hardcore gamer!

God of War is amazing! Everything is perfect about it, the story line is great, the intricate puzzles make this action-adventure game even better. All of the ancient greek mythology gods and monsters are in this, such as hydra, minotars, ares, zeus, athena, and much, much more. The hacking and slashing and magical powers along with awesome combos maks God of War an excellant game to replay over and over again.

It has been 8 years since Sly 3. I thought that Sly 3 will be the final game for Sly, but I was wrong. The game takes place after Sly 3 and the pages of Sly's book, Thievieus Racconus, started to disappear and it is up to Sly and his gang to travel in time to solve everything about Sly's ancestors. This game is awesome and hard.Main characters: The Cooper gang, a group of friends who met each other at a orphanage. Sly, the leader of the entire group and a master thief like his late father and ancestors. Murray, the muscles of the group, and Bentley the brains of the group. Carmelita M. Fox, a tough vixen cop also Sly's nemesis and romantic interest.The Cooper Clan, a group of thieves also Sly's ancestors. Rioichi Cooper, a thief, a master ninja also a master sushi chef in Federal Japan. Tennessee Kid Cooper, a thief in the Wild West. Caveman Cooper aka Bob, the oldest and the first Cooper clan member. Sir Galleth Cooper, a thief also a honorable knight in Medieval England. and Salim Al Kupar, a thief who stole treasures with the forty thieves in ancient Arabia.Villains: Cyrille Le Paradox aka The Collector, a thief like the Cooper family, and the main villain. El Jefe, a Cuban tiger who is a ruthless mercenary. Toothpick, a ruthless armadillo gangster and a greedy "sheriff" in the Wild West. The Grizz, a black bear who is a former pop artist and a art thief. The Black Knight aka "Black Tyrant" a large armored soldier with a mystery past. Miss Decibel, a British elephant who is a classic singer and she had a accident in her past leaving her unable to sing.Gameplay: Some chapters are hard and some are easy. The controls are easy and they stay the same from the 3 previous Sly games. In this game, you will play all of the gang members also Sly's ancestors. The treasures are back, the clue bottles are back and you will purchase new badass moves from thief net. Like the previous Sly games, you will get jobs to do and fight the boss. The environments are crazy, beautiful and they make the treasures and the clue bottles hard to find. For the first time, this game had masks for you to collect. If you collect all of the masks, you will get many unlockables, if you get all of the treasures, you will get a surprise that I cannot tell .Graphics: WOW, the creators did a awesome job making Sly 4 and the graphics are beautiful, sharp and crisp.As a fan of Sly Cooper, I gave this game and the rest of the 3 previous games 5 stars
Sly 2: Band of Thieves implies, there are now three characters to play around with. Bentley and Murray played supporting roles in the first game, but this time around they are fully playable and fleshed out characters in their own right. Bentley is a nervous green turtle who supplies the brains behind the operations by making the plans for the gang and taking care of all things computer. Murray is different in every way as a burly hippo who provides plenty of punches, belly flops, and all around brawn to get the dirty work done.

Back when i was still looking for the first Sly Cooper game, my mom asked this guy at a store if they had Sly 1.  The guy said no but asked if she wanted to buy Sly 2 instead.  She said no, but asked if it was any good for the future.  He said "Well, you know why they call it Sly 2 don't you?  Because it's twice as much fun!"  He couldn't have been more right!  I beat the first game, so i decided to move on to the second game.  I loved the first game, but it was short.  This is much better.Rather than just playing as Sly, you can play as Bentley or Murry.  Sly is still my favorite, but Bentley and Murry are both great too.  All of them have their own special abilities that make them useful for all kinds of situations.Sly:  He's good for pickpocketing and sneaking around anywhere.  Unlike the other two, Sly can slide on ropes, climb up pipes, and get to other areas Bentley or Murry couldn't normally get to.Bentley:  In hand-to-hand combat, Bentley's probably the worst out of the three.  Don't let that rattle your bars, though.  Bentley is the ultimate in stealth.  Just use his Binocucom (did i spell that right?) to shoot darts at enemys to put them to sleep.  When they're making ZZzz's, plant a bomb and get out of the way.  Your foe's about to go up in smoke.Murry:  Murry is useful for one thing: fighting.  Murry can knock out any enemy you come across with only a few punches.  He's not the brightest bulb in the box, but he's a fun guy to play as none the less.This game is great.  In the first game you were battling the Fiendish Five.  Now, you're going after someone else.  In Sly 2, you're after the Klaww Gang.  Your main enemy before was Clockwerk, right?  And, if you beat the game, you kicked his butt, right?  Well, now you're going to save his butt.  That's what i said.  You're going to save Clockwerk's butt.  Well, not really.The Klaww Gang must have heard about you kicking Clockwerk's butt, because they went to the lava pool where you did the kicking and stole Clockwerk's parts!  (Whoa!  For all of you out there who took that the wrong way, let me remind you that Clockwerk was a machine and his "parts" are, for example, his tailfeathers, his wings, his eyes, and even his heart.  Now, i hope we have that cleared up.)  Anyway, you have to get those parts back before the Klaww Gang does something with them.Also, some new characters are being introduced, along with the Klaww Gang.  Carmelita is back, but now, she has some assistants.Constable Neyla:  I think she's supposed to be some kind of white tiger, but i'm not sure.  She's about as sexy as Carmelita, so i guess that's why they are working together.  Even the greatest thieves can't excape sex appeal.  Neyla has a way with words and can make anyone trust her.  But can she really be trusted?The Contessa:  OK, i have no idea where we got a lady crossed with a spider as a criminal psycologest, but who would expect a racoon working with a hippo and a turtle?  I never liked the look of Contessa, but now that i have gotten to her in the game, i dislike her even more than before.That is as far as i'm going to go.  I've got typers cramp.  Anyway, i hope you consider this game.  If you havn't played the first one yet, play it, just so you can get a feel for the set up.  Also, you may want to see what Clockwerk is about.  The game is short, so it won't take you long to get to Sly 2.  Both are worth the money.  They belong in anyones game collection.  (Dang, i didn't know i typed so much!  This thing is looooooooooong!)

The GameNFL Street is seven-on-seven football where every player you pick for your team plays both offense and defense. On top of that, you can put any player at any position, enabling you to experiment with Warren Sapp at quarterback, Peyton Manning at nose tackle, Brian Urlacher at running back, and Peter Warrick at the corner.It's one of those games where football fans will be addicted after one score and the football haters will crossover when they see it because of the exciting gameplay that appeals to both sports and non-sports gamers alike ala classics like NBA Jam, NFL Blitz, and EA Big's other gem, NBA Street.As you play a game, it's not just about scoring points, it's about scoring points with style. The controls are simple as on offense you can lateral, hurdle, juke, or stiff arm, utilize your turbo to speed past defenses, and hit the showboat button to perform some of the most incredible taunts, high steps, and street moves imaginable, from dribbling the football along the ground like LeBron, to throwing passes behind your back, and even cannon-balling into the endzone. The more style you show, the more Gamebreaker points you accumulate.

As I said in the title, this is not a review. I just want to save like-minded people some time, and summarize what makes 2005 different from the 2004 title. While this isn't platform specific, the biggest upgrade this year is for the Xbox, as EA and Microsoft have finally settled, and online play has finally arrived via XBLive. I'd like to not assign stars at all, but Amazon doesn't allow for pre-release non-reviews. So I'm assigning 5 stars based on Madden 2004, and the promise of the following new features. It is not meant to be commentary about the 2005 title.I've done this for NCAA 2005 as well, but decided to adapt it for Madden as well. Everything in here is Madden-specific.GENERAL GAMEPLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- The hit stick: The Hit Stick is a brand-new control innovation whereby players can attempt to lay a big hit on their opponent by flicking the right stick. They are risky, as a mis-timed hit can be devastating to your defense, but it can all pay off with a huge hit and a fumble or dropped pass.- Reworked DB play/pass defense: Rebuilt from the ground up, with a focus on man-to-man coverage. Good DBs will now blanket their receivers better than ever before, and "shut down" corners will now play as such.- All alternate team jerseys are now available.- Updated player models for more intense realism.- Reworked stadiums, fans, and environmental graphics.- New running animations. "Over 1000 new animations added."FRANCHISE MODE IMPROVEMENTS:- Restricted Free Agents - Allow your young guys to test Restricted Free Agency.- Preseason Position Battles - Let two players who are similar in talent battle it out for the starting job.- Player Personalities - Players react to everything that happens to them and if things get really bad for them, they demand a trade. If you're not throwing the ball to your star receiver, you'll hear about it.- Franchise Tags - Tag players who refuse to re-sign with your team.- New Realistic Off-season Free Agency - Players no longer only care about money. They now look at your team, the players you have, your team prestige and lots of other factors.- Weekly Game-plan - Your coordinators provide you with a game-plan each week that contains keys to stop your upcoming opponents.- NFL Icons - They've acknowledged the stars in the NFL and they become Icons in your Franchise. These players influence free agents and affect morale if something happens to them.- Practice in Franchise - You can now practice with your current franchise team.- Improved Team Management - Teams intelligently manage their rosters now. They cut dead weight and sign regular season free agents.- Name Team Captains - You can now name your team captains every year in Franchise.- Rivalries - Rivalries are a new addition to Franchise this year.- Team Prestige - A new aspect of Franchise is prestige. Turn a perennial loser around to become a true powerhouse.- In-Season Player Progression - Players now progress based on how well they're doing during the season. Breakout players are rewarded for their performance.- Improved Draft - A ticker, announcer and trading during the draft highlight our draft improvements.- Change Player Positions - You can change the positions of players in Franchise every season now.- Storyline Central is a new addition to Franchise Mode this year that focuses on every story that is at the forefront in the NFL. The stories around your team now impact your team. If the rookie RB is pushing the veteran for playing time but not getting it, his morale will drop and it will affect his performance. You hear about the stories three different ways.1) Newspaper. Every team in Franchise has a newspaper from their local city that discusses only the stories that pertain to that team. We also feature USA Today, which is the franchise's national newspaper. In USA Today, the most important stories from the entire NFL appear.2) EA Sports Radio. They've added sports talk radio to Franchise, where host Tony Bruno breaks down the week's biggest stories. Each week's show includes call-ins, coach and player interviews, trivia questions and from time to time, Tony will rant about important issues in the NFL.3) Email. Every week on your PDA, you'll receive emails about everything going on with your team. You will receive emails from players, coaches, general managers, the PR department, etc.- Create-a-fan: Create your own dedicated crazy fans. To be included during game-time celebratory animations.ONLINE PLAY IMPROVEMENTS:- Opponent scouting: They've added a new scouting report that allows you to check any player's (online) tendencies. You can look at their favorite playbook and formation, as well as look at how much they no-huddle, call hot routes, and audible. It's meant to try and cut down on the number of games wasted to opposition that cheats or otherwise plays in a manner you're not interested in.- Quick tournaments: 4 or 8 player tournaments built right into the online system.- Even team mode: An option that will allow an even playing field, regardless of the 'real world' strengths and weaknesses of two programs/teams.- Improved leaderboards.- "Rushing Attack" mini-game, as defined above.- EA Messenger: Track dozens of friends online.That's all I've come across so far, but it's a factual aggregation of information, all directly from the source. Either Electronic Arts, and/or Phil Frazier the line producer via an interview on EASports, much of the info is paraphrased or even partially or wholly quoted. None of this comes through third parties, or speculation. Given that, this looks to be one of the biggest leaps forward this franchise has enjoyed in some time. Particularly for Xbox fans as they finally get online play, but really for everyone. But enough, I now return you to your regularly scheduled, "tHiS gAMe iz dA bOMb!" 'reviews'.

I really enjoy this game.  There are seven fractions that all broke up when they landed on the planet.  You must choose to represent one.  There are several changes that this game made along with improvement, A.) There  is now a concel that all the countries make up.  When issues arive they all  go to meet on the issue.  You can run for planetary governew where you are  essianly the leader of union.  I really enjoy this and it opens up the  option for a diplomatic victory.  B.) You now have boarders.  This is  simple where your city limits are.  An improvement for a possible AC2 would  be that you can move the boarders by notation and not but building a city.The one thing I did not like about this game was the tech tree.  I never  felt like I was in charge.  Only having seven diffrent fractions,  (countries) may seem like a down fall but if you stick with one fraction  you will become bitter rivals with other fractions.I would highly  recommend this game.  There is the enivitable question of wiether it is  better than Civ2.  That of course is tough compition but considering that  Civ2 came out a few years ago AC was able to update some parts.  I think AC  has a slight egde but CIV2 was more impressive for its time.

Buffy The Vampire SlayerYou can see why Electronic Arts has turned the cult TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer into a game - the show is a confection of implausible plot-lines, undead creatures and superhuman martial arts.The result is a third person action-adventure game, hugely influenced by the Tomb Raider series. The gameplay consists of beat-'em-up vampire-kicking action, interspersed with the odd puzzle-solving sequence. What makes it a must for Xbox owners is its sheer authenticity: virtual Buffy really does look like Sarah Michelle Gellar, and spouts the same lame Valley Girl one-liners. The control system also shines - it manages to avoid Tomb Raider's fiddliness, yet as you progress through the game, you accumulate a huge amounts of satisfying special moves.Mind you, the basic ability to drive stakes, mops and broom handles through the hearts of vampires is surprisingly cathartic in itself.Decent graphics, seamless construction of levels in which the plot unfolds plausibly and cameo appearances from Buffy's partners in undead-bashing add up to a game in which you really do feel in control of Buffy - a popular fantasy among TV-watchers, one suspects.Buffy The Vampire Slayer has no glaring flaws and is a must for Xbox owners in general, let alone fans of the TV series. One of the best Xbox games!

Sim-ers have always wanted pets. The additions of fish and hamsters were rather unsatisfying (and sometimes lethal) additions. This new expansion packs will allow your sims to have dogs, cats, parrots, turtles and lizards as well.Lots of new social interactions have been added, althought the Sims website has not been specific as to what those are. Your neighborhoods are bigger - 30 lots each which you can zone for commerical or residential use.  Also there are new homes, new parks, a new cafe, new shops and a farmer's market! Your new dog or cat can be brought to these locales and used to interact with your sim neighbors.  Just like in Downtown, time freezes when you're in the community sections.Each neighborhood will include a pet store, where you can choose from 12 different cats (e.g., black cat and siamese cat), 12 different dogs (e.g., dalmatians, beagles, french bulldogs, spaniels, rotweillers, labs, greyhounds, german shepherds to name a few), 2 different birds (lovebirds and parakeets), or buy a turtle, lizard or fish.  The Maxis folks haven't forgotten any of the details of pets, if you buy a male and a female of the same species, they just might have babies, dogs and cats (and dog and cat people) might not get along, and Kitty might take a liking to your bird or fishBeware - your doggies and kitties (but not the other animals) need to be trained and cared for so they don't go to the bathroom in the house or rip us the trash.  Don't worry - Maxis is kind enough to provide a dog trainer if you're feeling lazy. But, your pets are just like a member of your family - they will have needs and skills which can be acquired (through positive and negative reinforcement). Just like people, you have to develop a relationship with them.  And just like your people, they can die of neglect, so be careful!  Dogs and cats will also misbehave and get grumpy if you don't take care of them.  Dogs and cats can also be entered in pet shows with prizes for obedience, tricks and good pet mood.  You can't bring your pets downtown (although you can probably pick up a date in the pet park) but your whole family (including your pet) goes on vacation with you.There's new stuff for your house too - you can can garden! Grow 4 different veggies in your patch (you have to buy seeds), careful gardening will result in a crop which you can sell (at the farmer's market) or store (in your new kitchen pantry). You might appreciate your pets here as you'll need to watch out for rabbits, gophers, mice and, as Maxis says ominously, other "unwelcome animals that come a callin'." (Mice, which your cat can keep away, will join roaches as house pets.) There will be 125 new objects for you and your pets (no details on those yet either), a new decorator set (New Orleans French Quarter), new skins and 5 new career tracks (fashion design, chef, vet, teacher, circus performer).  Among the new objects are new chairs, new tables, new fountains, espresso machine, pastry cart, spiral staircase, and pet-oriented objects like food bowls, catnip, dog beds, treats, squeak toys, doghouses, pet gyms, chew toys, and scratching posts.

Even if you aren;t the most romantic kid on the block, you'll love Maxis's third expansion pack for &quot;The Sims&quot;: Hot Date. Not only does this pack add new skins (faces and outfits), objects, (such as the heart-shaped hot-tub), and wall/floor coverings, it also adds the all new &quot;Downtown&quot; area and dozens of new interactions (such as Suave kiss, Jump-Into-Arms hug, and Check Out). Downtown is a great new place because it now allows your Sims to go out to dinner, shop for new clothes, and meet new people. Also, if that isn't enough to do, you can add to the compilation of Downtown lots already given to you with the game by creating your own. Add a mall, restaurant, whatever you can think up to entertain those interseting little creatures, the Sims. After you have purchased The Sims, Livin Large, and House Party, purchase Hot Date. It will add a little romance to your Sims' sad lives.

I'm a genuine Sims enthusiast, but I'm kind of disappointed by this latest expansion pack.  It has some neat stuff, though.  About 8 new outfits for men and women, and 2 new outfits for girls and boys.  There are also some new adult heads.  And of course there are new floors and wallpapers.  (But this isn't too thrilling because you can download just about any kind of floor or wall or outfit off the internet!)  There are a few new doors (including a saloon door and restroom doors for male/females) and some windows (none too exciting), 2 new staircases and a transporter/elevator thing.  Add to that, some new shrubs, fences, and a cactus, and your Sim's yard can look really neat.  Indoors, there's new furniture.  They've added some new bamboo stuff, so if you want to reinact &quot;Survivor&quot;, that shouldn't be a problem.  They've also added new decor and accessories in the themes of Western, Disco, Warehouse, and more.  Then comes the fun stuff: a bubble blower, a buffet table, a cake for a dancer to pop out of, a light-up dance floor, a dance cage, etc.  Plus a new option to hire a caterer.  However, the price of this game seems a little steep for the amount of new stuff you get (which aint much).  But if you love the Sims and can't get enough of them, this is bound to brighten up your little Sim houses and make things a little more fun.  So... this is not a must-have but it's still pretty cool.  (Note: I have a newish computer and with this latest expansion pack installed, the game runs a lot slower than it used to... that's kind of frustrating.)

One of the most clich&eacute; yet possibly most difficult questions to answer would be the fabled "greatest game of all-time" inquiry. With virtually unlimited variables, everyone has a completely different opinion and with good reason. Can a multiplayer focused title really beat out a single-player title with an engrossing plot? Can an action game with gratuitous decapitations take on the adrenaline rush of a high-impact arcade racer? How about the intelligence and tactical nature of a strategy game compared to the immersive feel of a shooter? This usually leaves the debate at a standstill with names of great games being tossed around to supplement the absence of that one true answer. Endless as it may seem, I've found the answer.Mass Effect 2 is one of those games that's so engrossing from the very start that when you try to put it down something happens and all of a sudden you're under its infallible grasp for several more hours. The game continues the adventures of the ambiguously gendered Commander Shepard in his or her attempts to secure the galaxy from the cusp of total annihilation. With Saren destroyed, the Geth quelled, and the Reapers slowed, a mysterious race known as the Collectors have appeared and begun assaulting human colonies for unknown reasons. It's up to Shepard to build a team to find out who the Collectors are and what they have to do, if anything, with the menacing Reapers.Some may argue that Mass Effect 2 is playable without having touched the first game, but that's farfetched. Without experiencing the main plot, characters, and conversations that made the first so memorable, much if not all of the sequel's charm and weight will be lost. With that said, the story may seem incredibly commonplace, however that couldn't be further from the truth. As events unfold and characters are met you'll begin to see how involved this universe is. Everything you do, everything you say has an effect on the universe and the people around you. I've never cared for more characters in a video game than this one. Constantly I'd find myself roaming the decks of the Normandy in attempts to hold just one more conversation with the crew. The writing simply blows every game out of the water and with superb voice-acting complementing that, you've got the best story-telling system in gaming at your finger-tips.A very unique option to import your character from the first game is also present. If you decide to do this, all the choices you committed to in Mass Effect will carry over and have resounding effects in Mass Effect 2. These aren't small, menial distractions either. Depending on what you've done, the game could be completely different by just shifting a single choice. Experiences will be drastically different, worlds will change, and some colleagues of yours could end up dead; not the temporary kind.Like any good developer, Bioware has listened to complaints from the first game and in turn overhauled the sequel. Gone are the clunky and cluttered menus and the tedium of Mako exploration. The brain-dead AI has also been beefed up, the limited galaxy has been expanded and an effective gunplay system installed. Mass Effect 2 couldn't be more different from its predecessor. While this will anger those who enjoyed collecting multitudes of items and exploring worlds with the Mako, the way Bioware has streamlined their new systems is nothing short of marvelous. It also helps that the game looks nothing short of breathtaking.Perhaps the biggest, most noticeable change is the combat. At the game's onset you're asked to choose a class which, believe it or not, all play very differently. The Adept, for instance, is a biotic specialist that doesn't have much armor or weapon variety, but decimates with special abilities. Along with new class changes, Mass Effect 2 instills a much more effective cover system along with immensely satisfying gunplay. The game plays more like a conventional shooter now. Enemies react heavily to being shot, headshots do much more damage, enemies with armor dampen biotic power, and you can even arc certain biotic powers around cover. The inclusion of ammunition is also a fresh change that puts a spin on combat. No longer can you lay down unlimited fire as doing so will put you out of business quite early. All these combat changes have made the fights of Mass Effect 2 much more dramatic and all the more pleasing. It comes together so well it makes the combat in the first game look like it should have been on the Atari.With all the good, Mass Effect 2 isn't without faults. I happened upon several glitches that caused me to restart my game multiple times. Once, I was levitated off the ground and pushed into the ceiling with no enemies around. Normally I'd be aggravated beyond reconciliation but the game auto-saves often and, if you choose, allows you to restart that individual mission at any point. The only other issue I had was with the new planetary excavation mini-game. Since the Mako is gone you no longer have to explore the surface of planets. Instead, you can fire probes from the safety of the Normandy which earns you materials necessary for upgrades. It's much better than traversing redundant and boring landscapes, but scouting a planet can take upwards of 15 minutes to do. Later you gain upgrades to make the process much faster, but you'll end up skipping the excavating process on more than a handful of planets anyway.Mass Effect 2 is an anomaly. Not only is the writing and story-telling grade A, but the gameplay makes every encounter note-worthy. The relationships you develop with your crew members and the missions you attempt are so enthralling you'll put well over 30 hours into it before continuing on and starting a second playthrough. Bioware has taken change to a new level and given us an adventure of a lifetime. Skipping this game would be a sin to humanity.
The best way to describe Mass Effect 2 is as a refinement.  Bioware took what worked with the original, enhanced it, and either streamlined or removed what didn't fit.  The end result is a game which smartly improves on the original - both technically and in terms of plot - and turns what were weaknesses in the first game into strengths.Graphically, this game is a tour de force.  It retains the overall vibe of the first game and enhances it with better lighting and more varied locales.  The sunset vistas of Illium are just as thrilling as the Blade Runner inspired Omega Station.  The character models range from nearly lifelike (see: Miranda, who was modeled by real life actress Yvonne Strahovski) to intelligently subtle (Mordin, whose face and expressions showcase his age) to interesting (Thane, whose species, the Drell, are a new addition to the franchise).The audio is much improved.  The voice acting is even better than the original.  Old favorites shine, and the new additions more than hold their own.  Mark Meer, the voice of male Shepard, in particular,  has improved.  The weapons all sound different, and have a much more forceful sound than the generic dull thump they all shared in the original Mass Effect.  The music is solid, even if most of it seems to hide just beyond notice.The biggest changes are in the gameplay.  Mass Effect 2 plays a lot more like a 3rd person shooter than the original game did.  There's a reloading mechanism and limited ammo.  While the in-game explanation for the move is tacked on, it makes battles a bit more tense as you will run out of ammo if you don't manage your resources correctly.  Cover also matters more in the sequel.  It's far easier for enemies to chew through your armor and health, so it pays to fight smart and use cover to your advantage.  Above all else, combat finally has a semi-frantic, visceral feel to it.  Geth are dangerous here.  The weapons all pack a different kind, yet immensely satisfying, punch.  Squad powers and abilities are almost all useful and fun to use.  Combat is no longer a chore to slog through.  Instead, its rewarding in its own right.The maligned inventory of the original game is gone.  The changes one can make to their Shepard and squad are much more granular here.  It's an okay system, but I feel it goes a bit too far.  A happy medium can exist between the clutter of the first game and the minimalistic approach this one took.  YMMV, of course.The uncharted world system of the first game has been completely revamped.  There are far fewer planets with sidequests, but those that exist are far more rewarding and involved than the repetitious nature of the missions of the original.  Even better, there are no Mako segments anywhere to be seen.I'd speak about the plot, but it's hard to mention anything without spoiling it.  I will just say that many things mentioned in the first game are explored in much more detail here.  While not everything is answered, there's a lot of meat here for those that enjoyed the setting in the original to sink their teeth into.  The galaxy feels even larger here, despite the narrow focus of the plot.All in all, Mass Effect 2 improves on just about everything the first game had to offer.  It's more than just a worthy sequel - it's an incredible game in its own right, and one of the best ever created for the genre.  Despite its early in the year release, it should be considered a Game of the Year candidate.  Maybe 'refinement' isn't the best word to describe Mass Effect 2.  No, 'satisfying' is far more accurate.  In just about all aspects, Mass Effect 2 satisfies.  You can't ask for much more than that.
Mass Effect 2 is hands-down the best game I have ever played. It continues the story of Mass Effect 1 and expands the story dramatically.In short:Excellent GameplayBelievable, individual NPCsA very involved storylineDecision-based gameplayThe gameplay is excellent, introducing more differentiation between classes than the previous game and adding more interesting environments and fights. The characters I found more fleshed out and more interesting than in the previous game (including the characters who return from the first game) - in many ways, the focus of the entire game is on the characters.It's shorter than the first, by quite a bit, and includes fewer places to explore. But has a more tense urgent feel because of it, a momentum the story of the first lost a little bit in the sprawling, open universe.The themes in the story of racial tensions and bitter conflicts between some of the different species remains, as does the looming threat of Armageddon, and they come up in a far darker way than in the first game.The major emphasis on personal decisions is also a huge part of the game - decisions from the first game can change how entire planets are presented to you in this story, and your actions throughout this game can actually get both you (the main character) and any number of the NPCs killed.I do have one minor gripe, that is that the "default" new character assumes the decisions you made in the first game, and every single one of them was the opposite of what I'd done - luckily I was able to import my ME1 character. Because of this, and simply because it's best as part of the whole, I strongly recommend playing through the first game first.Also, more content is being included through downloadable content (DLC). This is good because it means once the game is over you can still do missions from time to time, but bad because they are charging for each new DLC. That said, it's something like $8 for a significant amount of content, and it's being used to actively transition the story from ME2 to ME3.
There are some definite improvements over Mass Effect 1, but many more steps backwards.  I think, as time passes, these steps backwards will become more apparent.My number 1 gripe with ME2 is that the story is pretty meaningless.  The story of ME2 does almost nothing to advance the plot from ME1.  It's almost as if this is an entirely new plot thread.  Nothing from ME1 really gets resolved.  I know this is a sequel, but most good sequels still resolve some of the plot from the first entry.  Why are these people joining my party?  Who are these enemies, and what do they have to do with the enemies from Mass Effect 1?My second gripe is that the seamlessness of the first game has been dropped in favor of a more level-based approach.  In the first game, I could backtrack and go to the Normandy at any time.  There were no doors that magically closed behind me, preventing me from going back to the ship and doing something else.  In this game, it's like each mission is a tunnel that exists completely independently from the other missions.  It's not a giant, open world.  It's a bunch of little tunnels that you travel to in your ship.ME2 did improve on the combat, but even this improvement comes with its drawbacks.  There is a huge focus on using cover, which makes this feel a lot more like Gears of War than Mass Effect.  That's fine, but it does make the battles a little predictable ("Oh...there's a bunch of crates lying around here.  I WONDER if there's going to be a fight coming up.").  Also, the way you use your biotic and tech powers is extremely limited.  Now, you can only use 1 power at a time, after which you must recharge.  This basically means that you need to find 1 good power and level it up, because the other powers are going to be pretty useless to you.  Same with your squadmates.Anyway, long story short...it's Mass Effect so you know it's at least going to be pretty good.  However, I feel like the first game had some things going for it that they didn't really improve upon.
Pros:+Gorgeous Graphics with some great anime cutscenes+An engrossing storyline+Really loveable characters+Easy to become acquainted with+Surprisingly large amount of customizationCons:-For those looking for innovation they won't find itThe PSP has slowly been gaining a lot of RPGs and tactical RPGs.  In late 2007 we saw the release of three Strategy RPGs in particular.  Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions, Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness and Jeanne D'arc.  While Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea were two fine ports from two fine systems, Jeanne D'arc stands on its own as an original creation.  The result is a beautiful, simple SRPG that while it doesn't change the face of the genre, it's a game that manages to be fun nonetheless.The story of Joan of Arc has been told numerous times.  However, it's never quite been told like this.  That is to say the story itself mixes in Fantasy with History.  In short, any student hoping to use this game has an interactive history lesson won't find it.  On the other hand, though, the story is well told through some fantastic Anime cutscenes that are by far some of the best to grace the PSP thus far.  There are some great characters to accompany you on your travels as well.  It also helps that the game has some spectacular voice acting with French accents that aren't overdone, but aren't too tame either.  The cel shaded graphics looks absolutely astonishing as well.  The environments are enormous and detailed.  The enemies are also pretty detailed as well.  In terms of production values, Jeanne D'arc exceeds by being both artistic, and showing what the PSP is capable of doing.  It's very rare when a game does both very well, but Jeanne D'arc does.A beautiful game can't stand alone without some good gameplay to go along with it.  Luckily, Jeanne D'arc has some good gameplay too.  It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but the simplicity of the game makes it so that there is no need for overly long tutorials that plague a few other tactical RPGs.  While this can be a little annoying for those who dwelled into more complex SRPGs such as Final Fantasy Tactics and Disgaea, it does have a few traits that make it overall fun to play.  As usual, you'll control characters on a grid and there are a set of objectives.  In some missions the goal is to defeat the enemy leader while making sure a specific character doesn't fall.  In other missions it's simply to crush all the bad guys.  The game adds a twist on this as well.  You must finish the battle in a certain amount of turns or its game over.  While this is a nice twist it's hardly something that merits being included.  You'll finish most battles long before you get that warning telling you how many turns are left.Much like other SRPGs you'll have a set of commands to attack your enemies and use skills.  Unlike many SRPGs, though, the counter attack rate in Jeanne D'arc is through the roof.  The good news is that this makes the battles go faster. That may be one of the things that helps this game out.  In many SRPGs battles are slow winded and last for a long time.  In Jeanne D'arc they go relatively fast.  In between turns you'll also see enemies and allies shout things out.  For a moment this is alright, after a while it gets annoying.There are skills at work in battle.  You can equip certain skill stones to let you do things like cast healing spells or perform special attacks in battle.  Equipping skill stones doesn't just grant you abilities or status enhancements.  It's also there to raise affinity with the three spirits, Luna, Sol and Stella.  There is no one spirit greater or more powerful than another.  This works in a Rock-Paper-Scissors, fashion.  One spirit is stronger than one but weak against the other.  This puts a lot more emphasis on strategy.  Some attacks deal far more damage based on which spirit you are affiliated with.  The same thing works for your enemies.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Jeanne D'arc is that the games transformation system.  Jeanne can transform once she has enough SP.  This gives her a significant boost to her stats.  It also gives her the ability to take another turn immediately after killing an enemy.  This is great, but because of the increase in stats in some areas it makes the game unreasonably easy.  That doesn't mean the entire game itself is easy.  You'll find that in many maps you're outnumbered.  And that a mishap or two in your strategy can cost you the battle.  Jeanne D'arc may be a simple game to learn but it can be a bit tough to master.Jeanne D'arc also sounds masterful.  The soundtrack is beautifully orchestrated.  While at some points the music can be repetitive (particularly hearing the "Enemy Phase" music over and over again), it still sounds absolutely fantastic.  If there was anything holding Jeanne D'arc back, it would be the games lack of voice acting.  While you hear a lot in the animated scenes, you don't hear them that much beyond that.  It'd be nice if some of their battle callouts, for example, were screamed out.  This is a minor problem and in no way detracts from the game itself, though.Any PSP owner looking for a fun, engrossing SRPG ought to look to Jeanne D'arc.  It's incredible story, simple battle system and good use of customization and balance make it an engrossing adventure.  It may not reinvent the wheel, but that keeps the game from being a needlessly complicated endeavor.

This isn't the first, or latest or even the best Real Time Strategy game ever made, but it's perhaps the best first game for those new to the genre.  In RTS, you build up both an army and the industrial base with which to create the army.  There is some valuable resource (here, the famed &quot;Tiberium&quot;) which fuels your war mchine and that of your opponent.  The inherent unrealism of RTS - you build the base and the army not only in real time, but in a rather short amount of it - is more than compensated by the tenacity and resourcefulness of your enemy, the obstacles you face and the myriad strategies you must quickly use to overcome both.  &quot;Red Alert&quot; is actually a prequel to &quot;Command and Concquer&quot; which pit the noble - if militaristic - Global Defense Initiative against the insidious cultish Brotherhood of Nod.  In RA, we find the younger GDI facing a massive war machine fielded by Josef Stalin's USSR.  How did that happen?  What about WWII?  Never took place - Hitler was some out of work painter and Austrian army vet when he died under mysterious circumstances after a 1924 meeting with somebody named Einstein.  Now the Soviets and the GDI fight using weapons that vary between conventional and (by our standards) exotic.In addition to your tanks, planes and ships, you must also contend with Tesla Coils (artificial lighting generators), chronospheres (remember the &quot;Philadelphia Experiment&quot;?) and the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot;.  You get to play each side, and must deal with each one's respective weakenesses - the allies are better represented on sea where their cruisers and gunboats annhilate russian subs;  Russian MiG's, however, dominate the sky).  Anybody whose RTS experience goes no further than &quot;Dune II&quot; (1992) best be warned - this is more than about tank-rushing.  simply cranking out a dozen or so of your heaviest and most fearsome mechanized armored assets and sending them headlong at your enemy's weakest point is not the single strategy.  As an exmple - one mission may have you decimate the GDI base on the other side of the river.  However, there are no bridges (at least none that last very long).  So you've got to build marine transports to carry your army across - but that requires a subpen.  To protect your subpen (which is built on the water) and the transports when they're built, you'll need to crank out subs (which are inferior to the enemy's surface fleet, but remain the only real option).  Also, your transports can only load and offload their cargoes on sandy stretches of shoreline - and the only non-rocky coastline just happens to be occupied by the enemy.  The allies may also have spies - who can walk past tanls and soldiers without being spotted (only your canine units know when they're around), and the feared &quot;Tanya&quot;, a sexy &quot;Rambette&quot; who can pick off scores of infantry like pigeons and responds with the appropriate &quot;Ka-chinG!!!&quot; with every kill.  Red Alert is incredibly challenging, not infrequently frustrating and quite addictive.  An extensive internet community exists for those with questions or those hungering for new missions.  I ran the game on my P-166MMX with no problems.  Those with more powerful systems may want to consider &quot;Red  Alert-2&quot;, but they'd be missing an excellent intro to the genre.

I have played the Chinese against the UN. I have, at my whim, subverted Venezuelan revolutionaries, kidnapped and executed executives, run tanks through VZ government palaces and exploded oil platforms. I have launched missiles at reinforced bunkers, chased gunboats through minefields, and dropped shipping containers on the heads of civilians from black helicopters. I have hijacked troop transports, destroyed historic castles and run guns for Jamaican pirates. I have blownup billboards with rocket launchers and run missile gunships aground. I have thrown more grenades and flipped more jeeps than I can count. I have stolen millions of dollars, sabotaged fuel depots, tasked satellites over refineries and dropped the mother of all bombs on a hillside favela. I have dealt with money grubbing gringo mercenaries, ball busting female insurgents, Rastafarian bird smugglers, pierced Irish playboys, ambitious Chinese colonels and drunken Russian pilots. I have swung from helicopter skids and thrown men to their deaths 3000 feet above the jungle floor. I have snuck through government checkpoints in rustbucket heaps armed with only a sidearm. I have called in carpet bombing airstrikes on UN peacekeepers. I have rained artillery fire on office buildings in the middle of business districts and watched them crumble in huge clouds of concrete dust while chomping a cigar. I have pistol whipped dignitaries and handcuffed them only to execute them because I have double crossed the clients who already paid my bounty. I have run armored personnel carriers through tarpaper shacks and demolished military barracks with C4. I have crawled out from under the wreckage of helicopters falling from the sky, victims of combat air patrols. I have dropped fuel air devices, cluster bombs and even a nuclear bunker buster that I extorted from an American general just to get revenge.I am the danger.

So far, everyone enjoys it. Quick info:**** REQUIRES ACCESSORIES --- PLAYSTATION MOVE AND EYETOY ****Pros:-Great song selection (40 - listed at end of review)-great workout-lots of references for following the dance routine-lots of fun, a real party gameCons:-don't see any options to get new songs (download or otherwise)-there seems to be a glitch with updating the software, it resets the PS3 rather than Updating (the disc works fine without the update however)Song list:-Amerie - 1 thing-Barry White - you're the first, the last, my everything-Basement Jaxx - where's your head at-Billy Idol with Generation X - Dancing with myself-Bodyrockers - I like the way-Carl Douglas - Kung Fu Fighting-CeCe Peniston - Finally-Chromeo - Night by Night-Dam-Funk - Hood Pass Inpact-Deadmau5 - Ghosts n Stuff-Dianna Ross - Upside down-Duck Sause - Barbra Streisand-Ellie Goulding - Stary Eyed-Elton John - I'm Still Standing-Fatboy Slim - Praise you-Groove Armada - Superstylin'-IDA Corr vs FEDDE LE GRAND - let me think about it-Jay Sean - Down-Kool and the Gang - Get down on it-Lady GaGa - born this way-LMFAO - Party Rock Anthem-MARRS - Pump up the volume-Miami sound machine - Dr. Beat-New Kids on the Block - You got it-Nicole Scherzinger - Don't hold your breath-OK GO - here it goes again-Outkast - the way you move-Puretone - Addicted to base-R.

Will supplement to what other reviewer's have said. Bought this for my wife. I have Rock band. Never owned a SingStar title before. If you like Karaoke this is the game for you. Much more difficult than the Rock Band vocals part, especially rapping which is tough. Resolution of videos varies from artist to artist, depending on resolution on which it was recorded originally (thus older videos or indie bands will have lesser resolution videos). Game with bundle brings 30 songs from different genres. Each additional song on the online store is $1.49. For those of you that are multilingual you can have access to some songs (limited still) in your language by switching languange. Right now the store has about 250 something songs (excluding the multilingual thing I said) with some known bands and some I have never heard off. Adding the PS Eye adds another dimension to the game. You can record audio only and video tracks and export them to a media stick. The online features are also very interesting. Quality of music is very good. Some people have complained of the volume of the vocal tracks, which I don't find so distracting. I seem to get more distracted by the videos (especially the Blink 182 video, which in some parts i just burst out laughing.) I liked the vocals for Rock Band more but I have only played Sing Star this twice. I think its a great party game provided your guests know some of the songs. I have heard that they will bring some new songs every so often on the store. Rock Band owners: Very little overlap in the songs in Rock Band and Sing Star!

Music games have come so far since the original Guitar Hero hit the PS2. Four years ago, we tolerated questionable covers of some of our favorite songs, and even as more music labels started lending their talent to the plastic instrument titans, a handful of classic bands remained unattainable. We had the Stones and Dylan, but there was no way we'd ever see Zeppelin, Pink Floyd or the Beatles, right? Well, still no luck on those first two, but after some cajoling and (likely) a proverbial dump truck full of money, Harmonix somehow booked the Fab Four for their first video game tour in The Beatles Rock Band.Of course, The Beatles Rock Band is not the first band-centric music game in recent years. Metallica, Aerosmith and Van Halen have all received star treatment from competitor Guitar Hero, while Harmonix did release a pricy AC/DC disc last year as a Wal-Mart exclusive. But for The Beatles --arguably the most popular band in modern history - the developer suggested that a major overhaul was in order. And while the results may no necessarily live up to that initial announcement, baby-boomer Beatles devotees and hardcore plastic rockers should both be thrilled with the game.If you've seen screenshots or that surreal Abbey Road commercial, you know by now that the core game doesn't deviate much from the scrolling tracks layout established previously in the genre. And though The Beatles Rock Band does encourage the (much ballyhooed) harmonies, my family, friends and I were often too tone-deaf to really put this feature to use. But while the controls remain tried-and-true, it's the presentation that truly makes this collaboration a success.While the first two Rock Band games were always stylistically more dynamic than Guitar Hero thanks to numerous visual filters, this Beatles edition's attention to detail and psychedelic backgrounds raise the bar even higher. Shea Stadium and the Ed Sullivan set have been recreated beautifully, while the Abbey Road sojourns offer trippy music videos for the studio songs never performed live. Many of the latter transport the band outside of the studio completely. (You'll ride aboard the titular vehicle for "Yellow Submarine," for instance.)This visual fidelity means that the customization options had to be sacrificed. This is a worthy tradeoff, as it allows Harmonix to show how the band's costumes and style evolved along with their music. Seeing them get from their early 60s mop-top/suit getup to the bearded rooftop veterans just prior to their split is truly remarkable. And assuming that you're playing the 45 songs in the order recommended for the story mode, you'll see plenty of supplementary photos and archival video snippets to back up the artistic direction.As for the actual track list, many reviewers have already expressed frustration at the small song list. I, too, wish that "Strawberry Fields," "Norwegian Wood" and several others hadn't been omitted, but at least 44 of the songs are truly wonderful, with the early cover of "Boys" as the only oddity. Tracks like "Within You Without You" and the downloadable "All You Need is Love" show that sitars and string orchestras can be adapted to the plastic instruments as well, so songs like "Eleanor Rigby" are possible in the future.For many of you, the opposite may be true - you're so sick of band games that even The Beatles aren't enough to lure you back. If you fall into this camp, I'd urge you to still give this Rock Band a shot. The music is so joyous, the presentation so impeccable, that you may find yourself hooked all over again.--Reviewed by Justin Hemenway
Man... After buying this game the first day it came out, wow..... I don't undertand whats with all the other reviews.  I played Winning 11 games all the time since my friend owns some but FIFA tops all the games.  the graphics of the players look realistic as they could push the creators to the limit, but they kind of look cartoonish.  The fields look awesome.  Everytime a player falls they leave a grass stain.  So many leagues including KOREAN LEAGUE!  although im kinda mad they had only 1 korean chant, taehanminguk but sounds like FIFA 2002 World Cup &quot;tae-han-min-gok.  I'm not sure about the other countries because I got hooked with K-League, BUSAN ICONS ALL THE WAY! URI HA NUN PUSAN, SANG GI LUR HA NUN BU (PUSAN) (PUSAN) (no i didn't mispell it)  Besides taht they have a practice mode where you play outside a fenced area that in the background has a sound of a chirping bird.  Practice your field kicks too.  BUT CAN ANYONE TELL ME WHY SONG CHONG-GUG IS ONLY 57!?!?!?! ALL THE ESPN ANNOUNCERS SAID HES AWESOME!  They have over 700 teams and a lot of players.  The commentary has improved although one of the announcers is annonying (talks dull except for the guy still from FIFA 2002 World Cup).  Overall I like Career mode the best.  It lets you control a team for 5 years and if you do good, youll get points to help your players but its only once a year.  STILL BUY THIS GAME, THIS GAME WAS WORTH THE $50O PIL SUN COREA! &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; O PIL SUN COREA &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; OP IL SUN COREA OOREOO FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT FIGHTALE ALE ALE PUSAN, ALE ALE ALE PUSAN, ALE ALE ALE PUSAN OOOOOOX3ALE ALE ALE PUSAN ICON X3O PUSAN ICON, UN-JAE NA SUNGPUL HAN NI AH-AH-AH-AHURI URI URI HA KI WE HA YO!

This game was fun. This had great artist's from the rap industry, this game was intense. Great character's like snoopdogg, redman, methodman, lil kim, seanpaul, fatjoe, elephantman, xzibit, busta ryhmes, ice t, stickyfingaz, and more. The move's were hot the enviorment was great, you can trow your oppoinet on a car, you can use weapon's, you can smash your oppoinet against the wall, you can do back flip attack's on the wall. The storymode was great to you can customize your character but the storymode was hard espacially when you face fatjoe he is a cheater in this game  but it was a great game. The last part in the storymode when you face snoopdogg was kinda hard to, he back flip's on the wall for advantage to take you out and so you fall out the window but i past that part, i beat the game already. The stage's were great to and the music even though iam not really into rap but it was good.

I've been into videogames since Night Driver.  Grand Turismo 4 is the best racecar game in existence.  It is also the finest specimen of graphic achievement on the PlayStation 2.  The entire system works.  The game is meant for the most capable recent home video systems.  Put the game in, turn on the high def television, turn up the surround sound, and you'll be hooked from the moment you see the green light.The game has a complete sound system work-up, meaning Dolby Surround (II) audio.  The rear speakers activate when a car is behind you.  The ambient sound in the game is great.  You can completely control over four hours of music tracks.  You can also control the volume levels of the ambience, the engine noise, and the CD music.  The music has a complete variety including rock to rap, techno to classical.  You make the playlist.  You can make a seperate playlist for a photo show.The visuals are awesome.  The game runs in high def widescreen at  1080-interlaced, plain anamorphic widescreen, or the NTSC 4:3.  This is a beautiful game.  The in-game menu has picture adjustment controls to get the right look for each viewer's video rig including contrast, brightness, and more, and you can multiply that by two because there are two full sets of controls, one for while driving and another one for the replay.  The landscapes of the raceway circuits in this game will have you gaping in awe.  You get the sensation of speed by the high frame rate and the landscape model artwork.This is the best Grand Turismo ever.  This game puts the entire race spectrum, of all backgrounds, into the pot and layers music to it, and that's in the metaphoric sense of music.  You can prefer Formula, LeMans, Rally, Indy Cart, or NASCAR.  You can prefer trucks, SUVs, old V8s, stationwagons, 2-seater spyders, or cars less than 3400mm in length.

I've been into videogames since Night Driver.  Grand Turismo 4 is the best racecar game in existence.  It is also the finest specimen of graphic achievement on the PlayStation 2.  The entire system works.  The game is meant for the most capable recent home video systems.  Put the game in, turn on the high def television, turn up the surround sound, and you'll be hooked from the moment you see the green light.The game has a complete sound system work-up, meaning Dolby Surround (II) audio.  The rear speakers activate when a car is behind you.  The ambient sound in the game is great.  You can completely control over four hours of music tracks.  You can also control the volume levels of the ambience, the engine noise, and the CD music.  The music has a complete variety including rock to rap, techno to classical.  You make the playlist.  You can make a seperate playlist for a photo show.The visuals are awesome.  The game runs in high def widescreen at  1080-interlaced, plain anamorphic widescreen, or the NTSC 4:3.  This is a beautiful game.  The in-game menu has picture adjustment controls to get the right look for each viewer's video rig including contrast, brightness, and more, and you can multiply that by two because there are two full sets of controls, one for while driving and another one for the replay.  The landscapes of the raceway circuits in this game will have you gaping in awe.  You get the sensation of speed by the high frame rate and the landscape model artwork.This is the best Grand Turismo ever.  This game puts the entire race spectrum, of all backgrounds, into the pot and layers music to it, and that's in the metaphoric sense of music.  You can prefer Formula, LeMans, Rally, Indy Cart, or NASCAR.  You can prefer trucks, SUVs, old V8s, stationwagons, 2-seater spyders, or cars less than 3400mm in length.

0007 Everything or Nothing uses an original story and an all-star cast of Pierce Brosnan, William Dafoe, Shannon Elizabeth, Richard Kiel, Heidi Klum, Mya, Misaki Ito, John Cleese, and Judi Dench as "M". You get to play the role of James Bond as you take on the bad guys. The game is fun and challenging at times, but there are few glitches that can become annoying.

We're slowing getting toward the ultimate boxing game. This is a big improvement in many ways over the last Fight Night game. However, although it is realistic in a lot of ways it seems as though you are able to throw way too many punches per round. I had an Ali vs Tyson match last night and the punch output was ridiculous. Ali threw everything at me but the kitchen sink including countless arcade-like power-punches! I landed a lot of good punches playing as Mike but they didn't seem like they were that effective. Everyone knows that if Mike hits you with a clean full impact punch, you're gonna get knocked down at the very least! But then again, I had played a few matches as Thomas Hearns and I was able to box just as he did.The lighter weight matches seem more realistic in that there is a higher punch output which suits the game better. I'm happy that they included a great deal of legendary fighters like Chavez, Duran, Hagler, Hearns, Foreman and so on. But I cannot see why they couldn't include Joe Louis, Rocky Marciano, Larry Holmes and Bernard Hopkins. I'm hoping for that either in the next game or an expansion pack. Anyway, I highly recommend the game! It ranks alongside of Knockout Kings 2001, Punch Out! and Victorious Boxers 1 & 2 as one of the very best boxing games ever created!
A few of the levels in this game aren't medievil,such as the gardens,the observatory,the academy,and the museum.But some such as the tomb,hall,sewer,cathedral are.Perhaps that's the only problem.You can play as DanHand,half head,half hand to get into small passages too.You also go boxing,when Sir Dan's friend,The Professer puts it on a Frankenstein-like body.You can even play without Sir Dan's skull on.And in the tomb you have to solve a puzzle of rescuing the Egyptian princess,Kiya.The main plot is that your favorite skeleton knight is awakened by a mad wizard named Palethorn,with the pages of Zarok,(remember that big chinned dress wearing madman who trapped the mayor,awakened the dead zombies,and tried his best to kill Sir Dan?) So Dan is awakened to attack the awakened dead.This game may be challenging though.And also you know,I suggest you buy the strategy guide.Get this game,it's fun.

Hi-Diddly-Ho There! Ned Flanders at your ser-viddly-ervice!!!The Game starts out with the Simpsons watching the news and they find out That Homer's boss, C. Montgomery Burns has bought the bus company and has made the buses radioactive. The citizens of Springfield won't stand for it. They are forced to turn their cars into cabs and boycott the buses, while collecting money to buy back the bus comnpany.This is one awesome game. If you're a big Simpsons fan, like me, you'll love this game. One strange thing about this game is that its just like Crazy Taxi in every way, except there is a primary objective that must be completed to beat the game, (collect a million dollars to buy back the bus company.) You can play with about eighteen characters and play on six levels. As far as game play goes, it is awesome. Graphics are phenominal and another cool thing is that the characters sound and look just as they do on the show. Here are the characters you can play with (their cars and best asset are also listed)Homer: Family Sedan  (All around)Marge: Convero  (All Turning)Bart: Soap Box Racer  (Acceleration)Lisa: Electric Car  (Acceleration)Grandpa: Go-Cart  (Speed)Professor Frink: Hover Car  (Best overall) (My Favorite!)Flanders: Station wagon  (All Around)Krusty the Clown: Clown Car  (Turning)Apu: Sports car  (Speed)Homer: Mr. Plow  (All Around)Snake:Lil' Bandit  (All Speed)Chief Wiggum: Cop Car  (Turning)Barney: Plow King  (All Power)Otto: School Bus  (Power)Moe: Sedan  (Turning)Groundskeeper Willie: Tractor  (Speed)Reverend Lovejoy: Book-Burning Mobile (Power)And Six Real Simpsons Boards:Evergreen Terrace  (Where The Simpsons live)Entertainment District(Where Moe's Tavern is)Springfield DamNuclear Power Plant  (Where Homer Works)DowntownSpring Field MontainsThere is only one flaw to this entire game, not all the characters in the Simpsons Show are involved in the game. other than that its perfect. So, what are you waiting for? Get it now!P.S. Vote Quimby!!!

I received this game for Christmas, and it's one of the best games ever!! My family and I play this game all the time, the multiplayer is fun for the whole family! This game is very high in replay value, because you have to raise 1 million$ to buy back the bus system from Mr. Burns. Along the way, you'll be able to unlock new levels and cars. The city of Springfield is jam-packed with familiar locales, like The Simpsons house, Kwik-E-Mart, Moe's Tavern, Springfield Elementary, The Nuclear Power Plant, Springfield Mall, Krusty Burger, even Moe's ramshackled house, and many many many many more! You can fly through the streets, crashing cars and flipping them, drive off bridges and highways, run over pedestrians, smash through trees,mailboxes,playground equipment, even Groundskeeper Willy's shack, and practically anything you see. You can pick as your driver Homer,Marge,Bart,Lisa,Flanders,Moe,Snake,Rev. Lovejoy,Prof. Frink,Otto, and many more, who all have their signature cars, like Homer in the station wagon, Marge in the Canyonero, Otto in his bus, Snake in Lil' Bandit, Krusty in his clown car, Mr. Plow (Homer) in his snow plow, and Moe in his flower sedan. Everybody you see in the show is practically in the game, either as drivers, passengers, or pedestrians, and they all say hilarious phrases, like Homer saying &quot;Did I do great or really great&quot; or &quot;D'oh!&quot;, Frink saying &quot;There is so much driving, and crashing, and the hoy-glavin!&quot; or &quot;The collision! It hurts mee!&quot;  and Moe saying &quot;Hope you didn't puke&quot; or &quot;Ow! I sat on my 'roids!&quot; which will keep you laughing the whole trip through town. This is immediatly worth buying, and no Gamecube owner should be without this game. BUY! IT! NOW!

The Simpsons Road Rage is a better remake of Crazy Taxi.  You pick up citizens of Springfield: like Homer, Bart, Moe,Marge, Lisa, Barney and many many others.  This game is really fun if you're a hardcore Simpsons fan (and you know I am).Each Character drives a different car: Lisa druves an Eletric Car, Bart drives a soap box derby car, Homer can drive two cars: Family Sadan and the ever-popular Mr. Plow.  This game has the same point as Crazy Taxi: get people to the place they wanna be and don't be slow!

I am never going into space. Never! I know it's unlikely that we will see commercial space travel in my lifetime (or at all if Einstein's theory of relativity is airtight), but in order to retreat from the horror of this game I just might run away to an island and live a life of coconuts and loincloths. Dead Space 2 ain't no tourist brochure for Outer Space.Having never played the first game I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to keep up with the story, but thankfully there is a 'previously on Dead Space' option on the main menu. You play as Issac Clarke, an engineer who wakes up on a colony on Titan to discover that a disgusting biological accident called the Necromorphs have taken over. On his way to safety he also fights against the Unitologists, a cult who worship 'The Marker', a faux religious artifact that is actually a man-made weapon that turns human DNA to sludge. The resulting Necromorphs (terrifying monsters made from re-animated human corpses) spread the chaos as Issac flees through the disintegrating colony while hallucinating his dead girlfriend as a demonic ghost.The dread in Dead Space 2 is overwhelming. It is honestly the most frightening game I have played since Condemned 2 (PS3). If you have a home cinema you can scare yourself to death by playing this at night, with the lights off, and sound turned all the way up. Every breath, every gasp, every distant rumble will make the hairs on arm stand on end, and some of the stingers (quite clever ones too) will cause your heart to stop beating.The gameplay is the over-shoulder, run-and-gun type you've seen in Resident Evils 4 and 5. I suppose it is a survival horror too, but the environments get repetitive and it goes on for a bit too long. There are 59 trophies (8 of them DLC) of which I managed to win 51%. Multiple play-throughs are required for the platinum but I appreciate my sanity too much to fight to the end more than once.I need to play something cute and happy to take the edge of now. Dead Space 2 is not for those of a nervous disposition.Graphics ASound AGameplay B+Lasting Appeal B
Dead Space 2 is one of my favorite scary games included Bioshock. Dead Space 2 takes in space a engineer named Isaac had to fight a deadly alien race called the Necromorphs again. The Necromorphs are scary enough to make me jump and scream, deadly, and they come in many different kinds. Isaac had many different weapons like the deadly Line Gun, the kickass Contact Gun, and the Plasma Cutter, he had different armors like the badass Advance Suit and the Elite Suits after you beat the game and play a new game. Dead Space had beautiful graphics but they had many scary scenes like the brutal deaths by the Necromorphs and the infamous Needle in Eye scene. If you made one single mistake, the needle will become a drill like needle, stab Isaac in the eye and killing him. If you like scary games, Bioshock games and Dead Space trilogy games are the ones. Like in the alien games and films: no one can hear you scream.
Many survival horror fans have gotten jaded. They think the genre is dying and in one review I heard someone saying Dead Space was RE 4 in space. While dead space has similar controls as RE 4 and even an over the shoulder 3rd person view point it is NOT remotely similar to RE 4 in atmosphere or level design.For one thing,Issac is not a super elite mercenary. When the Ishumura planet resource harvester ship goes haywire Issac's job is to do some routine repairs. However there is a bit of worry right away when he receives an odd SOS from his main squeeze Nicole who is a medical officer aboard the space ship he is charged with fixing up. Luckily her message is so subtle and obscure it does not give away the whole story right away.Along with Issac is a tough as nails take charge leader type and a female crew mate who is the shiznet at hacking and cracking. While these characters "help" Issac through a holographic communications screen with advice our poor protagonist ends up separated from his team and completely alone.Dead Space is really good at telling you everything you need to know WITHOUT accessing a menu. Issac's health is measured by the glowing tubes down the spine of his armor and almost all information is relayed to him through a pop up screen device on his helmet he can manipulate at a whim. Likewise the crescent glowing icon on Issac's right shoulder gauges his "stasis energy" used to slow the opening and closing of malfunctioning doors. This makes Dead Space a more seamless experience and lulls you into a creepy train of thought of playing the game without always having the reminders it is a game.Much like Bio Shock Issac comes to terminals where he can buy equipment such as ammo, health packs, and even new weapons. Each main ability or weapon is upgraded by circular disks called "nodes" you apply at fold out work benches. Nodes are rare, luckily they can be bought as well albeit at a high price. Issac even gets telekinesis. He can move things around and toss them similar to how Gordon Friedman does with the gravity gun in Half Life 2. Add all this atop of using gravity boots to mag lock onto walls and ceilings when in zero gravity it quickly becomes apparent Dead Space is not a tired retread or lackluster clone of Resident Evil. The only similarities it bears is that it is a hybrid between action thriller and survival horror. Luckily for those of us who love a good scare it is more terrifying and surreal than it is cheesy and over the top epic.You can run and gun in dead space (further accentuating the differences between it and RE). As a matter of fact when hordes of necromorphs attack it is a good strategy to run backwards while firing away, or at least getting your bearings as you occasionally let fly with some sizzling plasma bolts.So what are necromorphs? Apparently after busting apart a planet for resources the Ishumura away team found an odd artifact with ruins on it. Somehow this began mutating crew members into monsters. While that is not very original as a concept Necromorphs make ganados and zombies look tame by comparison. Even after having legs or an arm blown off these hideous freaks will still come after you and sometimes they may play dead after you hammer into them with a few rounds. As you confidently twirl your plasma torch and turn your back "wham!" you get a bone blade appendage through your kidney for not being thorough. I wasted a lot of ammo to make sure I decapitated every dead body or slain monster. Call me paranoid but hey, I rather be safe than sorry!Each level has a series of mission objectives that range from refueling the Ishumura to recovering the captain's log. While these may seem a bit dull at least they make sense within a science fiction setting . In dead space you never have to find a ruby and an emerald then put them into the eye sockets of a gargoyle statue. Normally a puzzle requires using your telekinesis to move something or using a stasis shot to slow down a dangerous moving obstacle so you can past through into the next area.While dead space is gory it does not just rely on blood n guts to frighten you. Even when you are not attacked by necromorphs the ship's metal haul creaks menacingly and the voices of the dead are heard whispering in select locations. You even pick up data pad diaries from Ishumura's crew  and as you can well imagine their last moments were filled with dread and hopelessness. Witnessing Issac having to wrestle for his dear life while locked in the clutches of a necromorph is not nearly as bone chilling as helplessly watching the person who seems safe behind a window get impaled and dragged into the shadows screaming or having to look at a nurse cackling insanely right before she fires up a bone saw and cuts her own throat. You wonder who you have to pity more...the grotesque creatures or those who were left unaltered as normal human beings?If you approach all this from the optimistic perspective of an enthusiast instead of an embittered fan boy Dead Space is a wonderful horror game. As much as I covet RE 4 and RE 5 and herald them as awesome games they are "thrillers". Dead Space quintessentially is "true dread" pumped right into your veins. It's not toying with your emotions or trying to be something it is not.I began playing it in the day time and it still got my heart pounding. For the foolish elitist bigots out there unshakable in their stance that "western developers" don't know diddly about true horror this game has arrived to bust their chops!In closing if you have played these games for many years you're not going to jump from fright every 2 minutes. Once you become accustomed to scare tactics it can NEVER compare to the glory days when you were a virgin of the genre playing Silent Hill or RE 2 for the first time. However to me this game is so excellent at what it does it deserves some grudging respect from the survival horror community.Pros+Intriguing story+Unrelenting terrifying enemies that give their all even after their limbs fly off.+Atmospheric creepiness that balances out the blatant blood and gore+Easy to learn controls+Can run and shoot.+Things such as anti gravity exploration and using telekinesis "mix up" the usual horror experience.+No annoying menus to jolt you out of the fear. Every aspect of the game from your health to gathered information is all woven seamlessly into the technology of Issac's suit!+Issac's "weapons" are actually tools to start with reminding us he is a mechanic and not a steroid popping space marine.Con-It's a space ship so some areas get to look very much the same after awhile.-Reading text logs via Issac's holographic visor is near impossible. In my opinion everything should have been voiced.-Enemies are varied at first but get repetitive later on.Pro or con??+/- Issac is a silent faceless protagonist very much akin to the hero in Bio Shock, Gordon Friedman in Half Life 2, and Master Chief in Halo. To some of you this maybe a problem however my take on it is as follows."Issac doesn't talk but it is the very fact he doesn't spout cheesy one liners or ridiculous catch phrases that makes his struggle that much more realistic, horrifying, and genuine."+/- There's alot of gore, perhaps moreso than any other game I've played. Sadly those that pride themselves on loving "psychological horror" are going to snub their noses at Dead Space a lot for that reason alone and in so doing miss out on the parts of it that are very surrealistic, thought provoking, and haunting.
Isaac Clarke, the unluckiest space engineer of the 26th century, is more unfortunate than ever in Dead Space 2. 2008's superb Dead Space took the style of survival horror shooter action exemplified by games like Resident Evil 4 and meshed it with an atmospheric deep-space setting and some terrific, distinctly sci-fi gameplay elements, creating something that felt simultaneously familiar and unique. Dead Space 2, on the other hand, will feel thoroughly familiar to those who have played the original; its few improvements over Dead Space are minor tweaks rather than game changers. But blasting the limbs off of hideous necromorphs remains tremendously satisfying, and although the pacing lags a bit during the game's middle portions, this second outing packs more than enough scares and surprises to make stepping back into Isaac Clarke's suit extremely worthwhile. In addition, a new multiplayer component successfully translates Dead Space's particular breed of dismemberment-focused combat into a pulse-pounding team-based experience that casts you as both humans and as the foul necromorphs. And, at least at the time of release, the PlayStation 3 version includes a hefty bonus: the great on-rails shooter Dead Space Extraction (previously a Wii exclusive), at no additional cost. As long as you've got the stomach for it, Dead Space 2 is one sci-fi horror thrill ride you definitely want to take.
I am a huge horror fan and this is one of my favorites.  It has everything; atmosphere, creatures, interesting weapons, and blood.  The atmosphere is good because you are on a broken down ship in space with things trying to kill you and it gets dark in some parts so it adds to the tension.  The creatures are insane to look at and of course kill.  There are some that crawl, run, and some that when you kill them will spawn other enemies that will try and kill you.  The weapons are tools you find lying around that are used for cutting, which is good because the enemies will not die unless you cut then up into little pieces.  That is why this game has blood, a lot of blood.  So any horror fan should play this game.

Get to it!  Pen up some smooth-hitting flows because that li'l freestyling pup from his 1997 debut has returned to the PS2!  Togged up in his claret beanie, some big ol' baggy pants, and a pair of funky red shoes, Parappa The Rappa must prevent his hometown from being dominated by the infamous Noodle Gang!  Suffusing burger joints with their noodles, the folks at Rappa's town fight back to regain their beloved, high-in-saturated-fat, heart-attack-causing cow patties.  Okay, so the third story in the series is not as charming as the first lovey-dovey one, but hey, the reasons why so many have hailed the first Parappa game as a brazen title is completely unbroken third time around (including Um Jammy Lammy).  Parappa The Rappa 2 simply rocks despite its lack of reconstruction or wave of advancement to its genre.The first one in the series was a landmark of beaming personality with its vivacious character designs and dainty backgrounds.  Its retrospective of colors and paper-thin models  were something to stare upon and talk about.  Parappa the Rappa 2 looks almost indistinguishably equal as the first but better.  Reintroducing all the attitude along with spiffier character visuals, the game runs smoother and juicier with a rich audio eminence.  Parappa's transposable charm is all rendered in the graphical ambiance as with the affluent scenarios found throughout.Although fairly undersized in length, with only eight levels, Parappa The Rappa 2 tenders what previous attempts have bided.  The saying, "if it ain't broken don't fix it," perfectly suits the nature of this game.  Basically, the player must tap in specific buttons in a rhythm in simon-says style.  Several buttons will appear on the screen and its up to the player to correctly hit the buttons displayed or commanded.  At the right bottom of the screen, the player's rating level determines how well the player is performing.  Obviously getting a good rating will advance players onto the proceeding stage.  The rating ranges from the lowest of "Awful"  to "Cool" as the best groove.  Should the player mess up on the button tapping, his rating will plunge from "Good" to "Bad" and finally "Awful."  Perfectly clocked in rhymes will have the player ascending on his rating.  If the player wishes to reach "Cool," then he must freestyle in between the commands given on screen by pushing any button as long as it goes with the flow and does not interfere with imperative commands.  Offering a two player battle mode and loads of button-smashing humor, Parappa The Rappa 2 doesn't shed anything quite new, but casts all the fun from as a splendid pastime.Of all the elements in Parappa The Rappa 2, the return of imaginative characters and their remarkable voice-overs is unsurpassed.  The music throughout the game drifts like a brilliant rap, presenting an appealing and positively inane (in a good way) tunes.In short, Parappa The Rappa 2's abrupt end left me ravenous for much more play.  Quite possible to be finished in one sitting, the game just begs for additional levels and challenge.  The overall quality in the game gleams, shimmers, shines, and what not, but the quantity of the game is the weakest constituent.  Even with its two player battle of the best freestyling spin-off, Parappa The Rappa 2's biggest quibble is the question of buying or renting it.  But don't let its shortage cloud your judgment because the game is just one of those games that'll you find yourself visiting over and over.  Though, next time around, Sony should flesh out a solid line-up of challenges and different play modes.  Boil it down and what you have is another fantastic party game.

Simcity 3000 Unlimited is currently installed on my computer and continues to please and delight me. The new features have doubtlessly been counted and recounted, I shall not go on with those. I have found all of the new  features fun and made the gaming experience more enjoyable, and worth the  cost of the upgrade. Giving my city a European and/or Asain flair is  delightful, as is being able to manipulate scenarios and buildings. I  debated about whether to get this verison, and if you are, I heartily  suggest that you go ahead, you won't be disappointed!I have had problems  with SC3KU freezing on my computer, however. I didn't have the same issue  with S3K, so I can only fault this upgrade, which hasn't been addressed on  their website as of yet.Onwards toward SC4K!

Dragon Age: Origins was a decent game, but most of the good content are DLC and must be paid for to get the full enjoyment for the game. At the beginning, the player customizes their character to play with, with their race, class, origin (background story), along with how they look like. After they accomplish their origin story, evenually all 6 of the origins (City Elf, Dalish Elf, Human Noble, Dwarf Commoner, Dwarf Noble, and Magi) will come to Ostagar and becomes a Grey Warden. Soon the city is attacked and destroyed, the only survivors are the player and a junior Grey Warden named Alistair. The player is able to recruit characters from throughout Fereldon, the kingdom in which the story takes place. The player's decisions and dialogue, as well as gifts, will influence the party members' approval, which is how much they like or hate you. Having a high approval for characters will give a boost on their stats and for certain characters, a chance for romance. On the other hand, if the approval rating is extremely low, the character may leave or betray you. The recruitable characters in origins are Alistair (human warrior/templar), Morrigan (human mage/shapechanger, Leliana (human rogue/bard), Oghren (dwarf warrior/berserker), Zevran (elf rogue/assassin), Wynne (human mage/spirit healer), and Dog (Mabari Dog warrior). Later in the storyline, at the landsmeet, the player can recruit Loghain Mac Tir (human warrior/champion), but then will risk Alistair leaving the party permanently. The player is supposed to use treaties to recruit armies from different areas of Fereldon to fight the Blight, a army of Darkspawn (tainted enemies) that are led by an archdemon taking the form of a dragon.
Looks like the lord of the rings fliks have made dungeons and dragons cool again.....This game is ten times beter than last years hack and slasher. Like the two towers Return of the King has an introduction level which is helms deep! How cool is that helms deep, minas tirith and the pellenor feilds all on the one game. Return of the King has 12 levels and nine playable characters including Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Sam, gimli and unlockable characters Frodo, Merry, Pippin and Faramir. Another really impressive thing is the co-op mode. People will have hours of fun The game is split into three paths The hobbits path ,the Kings path and the Wizards path.Yep I said Wizards Path. On a single player level I found myself as Frodo kicking some orc ass while Gollum is sitting next to me and agues with himslf. Another cool thing about this game is that when you get bored of the hobbits path Go hang out with Gandalf or Aragorn.Something else has changed Orcs no longer stand around pateintly waiting for there turn to attack they just gang up on you but each character has a special attack to get rid of 'em. Up ahead I see a stack of burning spears well, it would be rude not too.... Just tap the R1 button and the bearded conjurer will pluck out spear and fire it at the nearest orc. I can't say it enough EA really know expolosions. The musical score is from the movie which undoubtfully impressive. This is a great game but it could improve. For example when they talk their mouths don't move and it isn't long enough but is a awesome title and at least deserves a rent.Graphics: So cool you'll cry 10/10Sound: Awesome score from the movie 10/10Gameplay: Button Mashing but thats all you do 9/10Elessars Verdict: 9/10

The release of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King for xbox was much anticipated by many avid gamers, myself inculded.  When I first purchased the game, I was amazed that there were three different paths that you could take in the game (unlike the Two Towers).  The three paths are: The Way of the King, the Way of the Wizard, and the Way of the Hobbit.  The first battle you are automatically thrown into, however.  This is the end of the battle of Helmsdeep!  You are playing as Gandalf the Gray and must thwart the orcs and save Helms deep!  After you have beaten this level, however, you are free to chose which path you want to take first.  The Path of the King is the hardest and starts off with Aragorn, Gimili, and Legolas going to the undead to enlist their help to fight the Orcs.  The Path of the Wizard is slightly shorter, but not easy.  Here you play only as Gandalf the White and are involved in everything from the destruction of Sauron's tower, to Minas Tirith where you have to run around and knock off the orcs and the bombard towers, to the Courtyard of Minas Tirith where you are charged with protecting the women and children from the orc onslaught.  Lastly, the Path of the Hobbit is hard, but fun.  You play as Sam, most of the time and have to go through everything the hobbits went through in the movie.Once you complete all three paths, you will be able to play the Black Gate level.  Here you can pick from any of these characters (Gimili, Aragorn, Gandalf, Sam, Legolas) and you will have to fight , along side your allies to defeat the armies of Sauron outside his own Gates.On Completion of this level, you will be able to partake in the final level of the Game (The Crack of Doom).  Here you will play as Frodo and have to fight Smeogol inorder to kill him and destroy the ring.  Smeogol is particuarly difficult mainly becuase he is so fast and his hits take down your health fast.  Once you have beaten this level..CONGRATULATIONS!!  Now you can use cheats.  There are two bonus levels (the Palantir of Sauroman) that you can fight to get all of your characters up to max. level 20.  Now you can use all the characters (Gimili, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pipin, Legolas, Aragorn, Feramir, and Gandalf).As a last note...after the completion of any level, you will be able to buy upgrades for your character with exp. points!  And even better..you can go through the game with a friend!  Co-op missions allow you all the same level, except with a friend by your side!PROS:-  Excellent Graphics-  Co-op missions-  Tons of Levels to play-  After you complete the Crack of Doom, you can go back and replay any mission you want-  Great and useful upgradesCONS:-  On Co-op its not split-screen, you and your friend are on the same screen (which I like but some might not)Hope this helps!

My 6yr old got into skating so I bought him SKATE 3. He loved it, eventually I got SKATE 2 and then SKATE. SKATE 3 is a great game, but this is where it all started. He loves ROB DYRDEK, and yeas he is in this game!!! Controls are soooooooo much better than the tony hawk games. In SKATE 2 and SKATE 3 you can leave your board and walk, in SKATE you cannot
OHH SHIP!! this is a good game.this game is has one of the best stor lines i've ever seen in a game.it has allthe aspects of a grate game, and losts of gore to go with it. this game dus not hold back when it comes to violenc. i meen this guy is smashing peopls heads ,cuting heads off,etc.. this is a grate game for the teen and older but not for the little kid. that is way it is rated &quot;M&quot;. one prblem i have is the targeting , you have to target some one if you want to hit him/her, rather then just attacking them. in some cases this is good but it gets old after a wile.I reomend renting it, But if you dont like renting game go bay this one.That all for me.
