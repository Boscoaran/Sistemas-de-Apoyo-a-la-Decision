Good effort on SOCOM .... although it is not ZIPPER !! .....yeah, it seemed that after Fireteam Bravo 2, it was demanded from the Management an immediate continuation that ZIPPER was not able to deliver and so was delivered to someone else who tried their best and in some points achieved it but in general lack of old ZIPPER genius, as well, this Bravo 3 was so short which shows the urgency to deliver ASAP !! ....

Here is a word that discribes this game: bad, I know that some people like bad as it helps to bring excitement to their otherwise mundane lives. But your life can be so much more if you use the time you play this game to improve you situation and get the respect you want by doing things for others. Oh yeah here are a few other words for this game: abominable,amiss, atrocious, awful, bad news*, beastly, blah*, bottom out, bummer*, careless, cheap, cheesy*, crappy*, cruddy*, crummy*, defective, deficient, diddly*, dissatisfactory, downer*, dreadful, erroneous, fallacious, faulty, garbage, awful, gross*, grungy*, icky*, imperfect, inadequate, incorrect, inferior, junky*, lousy*, not good, off, poor, raunchy*, rough, sad, scuzzy, sleazeball, sleazy, slipshod, stinking, substandard, synthetic, the pits*, unacceptable, unsatisfactory

Puke, why calm this socom? It's more like Seth Luisi's incest love child with 2 left thumbs. Buy a ps4 in Jan 2015 and pick up H-Hour from Sof Studios. David Spears, one of the original creators of Socom I and II from Zipper, launched this concept on Kickstarter and will be ready for release in feb 2015! G^ noobs

This game is like Enter the matrix it starts off good butthe replay value is bad. It will never be as good or betterthan goldeneye or timesplitters,(1 or 2) the FPsof the game is too slow and strategized and not fast pasedlike other FPS's. The driving is pretty good though i'd give that4stars, but other wise, if you are A bond fan only, and likeany game thats an FPS i reccomend this game to you. otherwiseif your a multiplatform, multi-genre gamer like me, idon't reccoment it to you.

el juego fue parte del combo para la PS3 80GB, asi que uno siempre le busca el lado positivo.pero un juego que se jacta de soportar hasta 12 jugadores, como es posible que no sea capaz de simplemente dejar que dos controles se conecten y puedan jugar.uno se pregunta si los dise&ntilde;adores son inexpertos o simplemente no les importa ofrecer un buen producto para obligarlo a comprar otro.  verdaderamente una decepcion.en si el juego es bueno sino fuera por lo anterior y definitivamente no vale la pena comprarlo.
El juego no es malo, pero me siento TOTALMENTE decepcionado. Soy comprador de FIFA desde el 2007 y esta entrega se la vendi a un amigo porque me parecio una falta de respeto TOTAL a los usuarios del juego.Como primera medida, las diferencias entre el FIFA 2011 y el 2012 a nivel de juevo NO SON tantas como anuncian, salvo detalles, el resto es mas marketing que otra cosa.Por otro lado y el PEOR punto del juego es Ultimate Team.En la version anterior usaba Ultimate Team TODOS los d&iacute;as, jugaba online TODOS los dias y hasta en el trabajo estaba detras de que item habia vendido o cual habia ganado... asi que era una adiccion total... hasta que salio el Fifa 2012. Cambiaron el dise&ntilde;o de la web a uno que a mi como dise&ntilde;ador no me lleva mas de 5 hrs de trabajo, minimizaron el tama&ntilde;o de las cartas, la resolucion en la calidad de las imagenes de los jugadores y lo que es peor: LA INDUMENTARIA ES MAS CHICA Y DIBUJADA! Ahora ya no se le ven los detalles como antes, de logos, costuras, publicidades, detalles de cada indumentaria en si...Es por todo esto que yo NO RECOMIENDO en lo mas minimo la compra de Fifa 2012 y espero que la version 2013 la mejoren porque sino me pasar&eacute; directamene a otra entrega como PES.Exitos.
El juego es excelente, el online medio fastidioso pero bueno hay que acostumbrarse... algunos fallos pero nada que lamentar.El envio como siempre fue de calidad, Amazon siempre me ha cumplido.
El juego es divertido, buena acci&oacute;n... algunos fallos pero nada que lamentar.El envio como siempre fue de calidad, Amazon siempre me ha cumplido.
Compr&eacute; este juego basado en comentarios y en un poco de nostalgia por otros juegos de boxeo, sin embargo, esperaba m&aacute;s'. ahora lo tengo guardado esperando que alguien me lo pida prestado pra no verlo mas...

I was very excited when I found out that PaRappa was coming to PS2. I thought it would be bigger, better and more difficult-- but it turned out that I was wrong. I was very disappointed to find that there are only 8 levels, all at pretty much the same difficulty level-- if you've beaten PaRappa 1 or UmJammer Lammy, you can probably finish this one within one sitting without any problems. Besides the easiness, there are other glaring faults: the storyline is incoherent and boring (everything is being turned into noodles, or something like that), and the lengthy movies between levels have bad translations and aren't very exciting. The actual songs are nowhere near as funny and clever as the original ones, and the paper-thin graphics, which were charming on the PS1, seem cheap and out of place on the PS2. After I beat the last level, I wished that I hadn't bought it-- it was just way too easy and unfulfilling. Also, while UmJammer Lammy unlocks tons of bonus levels after you finish, PaRappa2 has none. However, despite these faults, I would definitely recommend PaRappa2 as a rental to any PaRappa fan-- even if it is a waste to buy.

I was a big fan of Parappa the Rapper and I was seriously disappointed with this sequel. It's bad enough that you can beat it in 30 minutes, but what's worse is that you wouldn't want to! The music is just bad and that is inexcusable for a music game. Where are all the catchy tunes? I can't remember one line from this game, whereas I have all of Parappa the Rapper's songs memorized. It's missing those great lyrics found in Parappa like my favorite: &quot;Sunny in my life, she's like a dice, I can't tell which way to turn 'till I spice!&quot; Skip UmJammer and get Parappa.

Avoid installing this on a computer. The software limits you to 3 installations before you have to re-purchase the game, and installing the game installs what is basically spyware/malware, SecuROM, which is known to damage computers, allow hacker access, prevent other games from properly working, disable your CD-ROM from working, and disable your anti-virus software.
Free time installation has been known to require a anti piracy download known as securom which fries cd burners slows your pc and has been even known to disable your pc. Purchase at your own risk.
This game requires a dangerous anti piracy download known as securom to install which will disable cd burners slow your pc and even disable it. Purchase as your own risk.
Buyer beware - the product description does not describe some importantaspects of the game:This game requires an Internet activation, so if you have no Internetconnection you can't play.Also you are limited to 5 activations - so effectively you are not buying and owning a game, you are merely renting the game.This game secretly installs copy-protection software called SecuROM which can cause many problems for your computer, some of which are:1. When installing the game the user is not informed that SecuROM is being installed.2. SecuROM denies administrators full access to their PC, and blocks theadministrator from editing certain parts of the registry.3. SecuROM can interfere with the operation of hardware, specifically disc drives.4. SecuROM can interfere with the proper operation of software.5. When the game is uninstalled SecuROM is not uninstalled - it remainspermanently on your computer.6. The manner in which SecuROM runs on your computer is similar to that of malicious software called malware, and many people do indeed consider SecuROM to be malware.There have (at May 2009) been five class action lawsuits have been filedagainst Electronic Arts (EA) for their use of SecuROM.

Sid Meier is a true artist in the realm of software, but with each new addition to the Civilization family the games become more oriented toward conflict and less fun to play. In AC the Believers will appear on your  borders within the first 50 turns and you will never really be at peace  again. Forget about the fun of managing a nation: this is a non-stop  Darwinian struggle to keep your head above water. (Some players might like  this, but I find it tedious.) There's no point in trying to negotiate with  other factions because they'll just turn right around and violate your  territory or declare war. Then after you have spent decades trying to build  up your industry, when your output reaches a certain level the planet  itself will being to attack you with an inexhaustible supply of mindworms.  *Every* game of AC is a race to achieve the victory conditions before the  planet itself defeats you, and there's not much sense of satisfaction in  that. Add to this the fact that the game runs unbearably slowly. You will  spend more time watching units go plod-plod-plod across the screen than you  will playing. I really wanted to like this game, but after a while its  defeatist atmosphere and tedious play just got too wearisome. Let's hope  that in his next game Side remembers that growing an empire is more fun and  challenging than beating one.

BOUGHT THIS LAST YEAR IN 2003 with World Cup 2002 Korea/Japan (KKOREA FINISHED IN 4th PLACE!) and this game has made some improvements and BAD improvements: Comparing with World cup 2002: NO CHANTS HOWEVER FOR KOREA IS WIN, you can barely make out Daehanminguk but it sounds like Daehangok.  The more frustrating thing is that FIFA 2003 graphics and movements is worser than WORLD CUP 2002!  They don't even include their first names such as Kim Tae Young and Kim Do-hoon, can't tell much of a difference.  I was suprised to see however that tere were chants like the famous, &quot;O Pil-Sun Corea!&quot; but they say in FIFA 2003, &quot;O Corea!&quot;  Well anyways I also saw some teams like Pusan Icons and Pohang Steelers with Kim Byung-Ji in it.  Although there are no star players as in World Cup 2002, World Cup 2002 only gives you 42 country teams and 5 All-Star Teams: All-Europe, All-Asia, All Africa, All-America, and All-World (Surprisingly they put Nakata as one of the few Asians in the All-Asia, no Koreans and in my opinion, Hwang-Sun Hong is way better than Nakata!) So if you had to pick from World Cup 2002 and FIFA 2003, just get FIFA 2003! I found out the hard way

On a world that depends on magical energy for it's motive power two races vie for control of the scarce source of that power - spirit stones.  Humans seek them out to run their maachines, and the Deimos, or demons, seek them because their very nature is magical.  Children of a rare Deimos/Human relationship two brothers who were seperated at birth are drawn into a web of conflict that makes them mortal enemies - each raised by a different race, each sworn to defend their own by killing the opposite.  Kharg and Darc are their names and this is the story of how they discovered that there are even worse enemies out to destroy them both.The game is a standard RPG in format, but shifts the player back and forth between Darc's demon quest abd Kharg's human one.  As the game builds the player can select characters for battles, and chose how individuals will develop skills.  The plot meanders back and forth across the face of the world in carefully orchestrated fashion, the only variable being how many random conflicts one finds.  You need a large number of these, since money and spirit stones are extremely scarce commodities.  So hard to find that their acquisition will become the primary fixation of the game.The reason for this is that you have to stop fighting and actually pick up your winnings during the battle, rather than receive a lump sum payment.  As a player who likes to acquire new weapons and skills, I found this irritating - too often you leave a titanic struggle with almost nothing to show for it.  The other big flaw in the game is that it is completely linear.  The game makes sure that you always do the right thing in the right order, which limits its replayability.  Many people are comfortable with this kind of game, but I find that, once you taste freedom, you don't want to head pack.But most of my issues with Arc the Lad have to do with playing it right after playing Final Fantasy X-2.  The result is that I became acutely aware of it's shortcomings.  Of course, FFX-2 was created to be an extravaganza, and Arc the Lad was developed to be something less - just another decent, playable RPG.  Thus the plot, which is really adequate for an RPG, comes of as glaringly tepid and character development seems sketchy and archetypical.  Yet, had I played this a year ago I would have liked it much more.  In any case, Arc the Lad is quite playable, even if it fails to meet the compelling quality of some of the releases of the past few years.

Greatness is something that transcends mere words, like what really makes a hero a hero, being in the right place at the wrong time and mearly doing what you have to do or volunteering to do the impossible, knowing the odds are against you, knowing that you may have to pay the ultimate price for something you've committed to do.  Hero's are born out of honor and commitment; a heroic act rises far above our understanding or the understanding of those who commit them... we're talking about a video game right?  Well, not exactly but as we are coincidentally about to, what does make a video game great, what gives one that illusive "Wow Factor!"?  Does EA's Medal of Honor Frontline for Xbox have it, lets discuss shall we?EA's Metal of Honor Frontline has been wrapped in the flag for months now, hailed as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time and I must admit, I fell victim to the hype and the demo's and as a veteran marketing professional, I can assure you I am skeptical and cautious about the choices I make based on hype but I have to admit, I fell for this one hook line and sinker.  What we're led to believe about MOHF it that it takes us places few men with any concern for self preservation would dare to go, we're lured into the promise that we'll stand shoulder to shoulder with boys who became men of greatness yet what EA has managed to do is water down some of the most powerful events of WW2 into a video game and even as a video game it falls flat when transposed against all the hype.The Achilles heal of MOHF is that it, like so many other decent Xbox games is a PS2 port, the graphics are murky and lack luster.  The visuals are a complete disappointed compared to what the Xbox offers in so many other stunning titles; Splinter Cell, Enclave, Project Gotham, Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee or even the visually stunning but non-game Shrek.  As a matter of fact the textures are just plain flat, Dreamcast could have easily offered much better so the fact that we Xbox owners rubbed our hand together impatiently waiting for this version of MOHF is a disappointment to be sure.Game play is just that, game play; the immersion goes only as far as the next herd of Nazi's you have to mow down around every corner, although to be fair, the D-Day invasion is tense and (for a game) stunning, but beyond that it's all just simple run and gun, with very little concern for strategy and stealth, which at their basic levels are important factors in the survival of any man put to the test on the Frontlines.Frame rates are solid and the musical score is brilliant, it could easily have been lifted from the some of the best features on the big screen but beyond that MOHF's use of one of mankind's most epic struggles as a backdrop is simply and sadly a gimmick dressed up in surplus military cloths like a bunch of ten year old kids playing war in the backyard.Where a game like MOHF should at the very least make my guts turn at the notion of the high price paid by so many young men praying to just make it through another second alive not to mention home in one piece, it leaves me cold and empty wondering how those same boys that paid the ultimate price on those cold beaches would feel knowing teenage boys not much younger than themselves were making a game out of their sacrifice.  And although paying the sticker price for a game like MOHF can hardly be described as paying the ultimate price, what you get for the money, sure does sting a little in the area around your wallet and I don't even get a Purple Heart for that.
Greatness is something that transcends mere words, like what really makes a hero a hero, being in the right place at the wrong time and mearly doing what you have to do or volunteering to do the impossible, knowing the odds are against you, knowing that you may have to pay the ultimate price for something you've committed to do.  Hero's are born out of honor and commitment; a heroic act rises far above our understanding or the understanding of those who commit them... we're talking about a video game right?  Well, not exactly but as we are coincidentally about to, what does make a video game great, what gives one that illusive "Wow Factor!"?  Does EA's Medal of Honor Frontline for Xbox have it, lets discuss shall we?EA's Metal of Honor Frontline has been wrapped in the flag for months now, hailed as one of the greatest first person shooters of all time and I must admit, I fell victim to the hype and the demo's and as a veteran marketing professional, I can assure you I am skeptical and cautious about the choices I make based on hype but I have to admit, I fell for this one hook line and sinker.  What we're led to believe about MOHF it that it takes us places few men with any concern for self preservation would dare to go, we're lured into the promise that we'll stand shoulder to shoulder with boys who became men of greatness yet what EA has managed to do is water down some of the most powerful events of WW2 into a video game and even as a video game it falls flat when transposed against all the hype.The Achilles heal of MOHF is that it, like so many other decent Xbox games is a PS2 port, the graphics are murky and lack luster.  The visuals are a complete disappointed compared to what the Xbox offers in so many other stunning titles; Splinter Cell, Enclave, Project Gotham, Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee or even the visually stunning but non-game Shrek.  As a matter of fact the textures are just plain flat, Dreamcast could have easily offered much better so the fact that we Xbox owners rubbed our hand together impatiently waiting for this version of MOHF is a disappointment to be sure.Game play is just that, game play; the immersion goes only as far as the next herd of Nazi's you have to mow down around every corner, although to be fair, the D-Day invasion is tense and (for a game) stunning, but beyond that it's all just simple run and gun, with very little concern for strategy and stealth, which at their basic levels are important factors in the survival of any man put to the test on the Frontlines.Frame rates are solid and the musical score is brilliant, it could easily have been lifted from the some of the best features on the big screen but beyond that MOHF's use of one of mankind's most epic struggles as a backdrop is simply and sadly a gimmick dressed up in surplus military cloths like a bunch of ten year old kids playing war in the backyard.Where a game like MOHF should at the very least make my guts turn at the notion of the high price paid by so many young men praying to just make it through another second alive not to mention home in one piece, it leaves me cold and empty wondering how those same boys that paid the ultimate price on those cold beaches would feel knowing teenage boys not much younger than themselves were making a game out of their sacrifice.

I own all of the Arc the Lad games and have played through 1 & 2, I still haven't bothered beating three. When I heard this game was coming out I had to own it. We bought it and I started playing. First impression was, "This game is awesome!" but after playing for a while I lost my enthusiasm. I went ahead and finish the game and now I have a slight distaste for the game. I'll explain what I liked and what i didn't.The best part I would say is the battle system. It is a tactics turn based system which is true to the original Arc the Lads, but it adds a three dimensional element to it which makes it even better than the originals. The game looks really nice too. The stages and towns look beautiful and the world maps are again reminiscent of the originals.The things I didn't like were the story and the character and the ending. The game focuses around two brothers who are both half human and half daemos. One is accepted by humans and the other isn't accepted by anyone. This would be an excellent setup and it added to my initial enthusiasm, but as the game went on I started to empathise with Darc and the Daemos and despise Karg and the humans. I still had to play as the humans though for what is at least half the game. The two teams only come together for the final stage and never resolve the conflicts between them. I found that annoying. The game ends with human and daemos still hating each other and the "spirits" gone. Since both human and daemos have great need of the spirit stones it is suggested that the "twilight of the spirits" might lead to war. I felt like that should be the real beginning of the game rather than the end.For the people who have been following the series there is no data load from three. You don't see anyone from any of the original games at all, though they are mentioned occasionally. Anything related to the earlier games felt more like an Easter Egg then anything important to the plot. I wouldn't mind any of this if they were planning on continuing this series in the same way they did Arc the Lad 1 & 2, in fact that would be awesome, but I don't see them doing that.Just as itself this game could only be called decent, but when paired with the original three it couldn't even be called that. I can't say the game isn't worth playing, but be prepared to be disappointed often by the anti-climatic plot.

Wot can i say? this is 1 of a kind game. u dont see many 3d games about u and controlling little virtual people! Its so much fun and the possibilities are endless. u can have an affair with the hot maid, get married 2 an ailen, focus on ur work soley, earn alot of money snog alot of ppl, have millions of granchildren and so on and so on. It took me ages making ma sim family and i done thm all down 2 evry last detail (evn to the chubbieness of thier cheeks). thn i played it for sum time (about 3 weeks i think) and realised tht the graphics were real gd!! Not good Great. well they had 2 b didnt they? if it costed me 130 for an upgrade for ma pc just 2 play a 30 game. thn after a while i found sum really annoying bugs. and sum things tht r'nt very realistic in the game. 1st i'll point out sum unrealistic things about the game. y do they put the radio on for no reason evn whn they know sum1 is sleeping?? n' y do they age soo fast?? and y do nevr know wot beds theirs?? i mean every1 knows whos beds whos! y cant they??Now on 2 the bugs. i'll just list a few out of a possible 14 in the game. i mean all this time looking and searching for bugs Maxis didnt do a very gd job of FIXING thm all. the bug tht annoys me the most is whn a visitor comes ova and is holding ur baby/toddler whn he/she leaves while holding a toddler/baby they dont put thm back down or in their crib, no no, they walk of screen with ur baby and u'll neva c it again-its gone for ever. Another bad bug is whn the maids van disappears but u still hear the engine for ages. same with the r.c. car. and sumtimes whn teens sneak out they never come bak. also it pisses me off whn a npc gets stuck in ur bit and it really slow the game down. It also bugs me whn sum1 dies or moves out they are still in the family photo whn about 2 go in2 a house! y? and its happened 2 me a couple of times tht once 2 adult try 2 get the same toddler at the same time the 1st 1 their grabs it and streaches their arms all the way behind thm for sum reason. and i absoulty H8 the nanny. she puts ma toddler in the chair thn out the chair thn bak in the chair and out the chair thn in the chair an.......till ma bay gets really mad and i get it taken off me!!Overall a reall gd 1 of a kind game but if it didnt cost 2 much for all those upgrades ( u must admit the minimuim requirements are for 2 big for ur aging computers), if it a little more realistic and it didnt have SOOOOOOO MANY BUGS!!!!!!! it would definetly deserve a five stars and a game of the year award! but it hasnt..... were now waiting for maxis 2 make sum patches for sum of the bugs real slowly!! diapointing maxis, disapointing! :(

This is the ultimate ant farm for those who can't afford one. You get an ant and you dig a nest. You bring green food to feed your queen. You avoid the spider. You repeat. You can while away hours and hours with this game,  digging away happily, but then you will suddenly realize that you were  digging for naught. Why?- When you switch between yard quadrants, all  you work is replaced with a randomly-generated nest.- The &quot;warp  spot&quot; is always in the same place.- The ants do just as well with  your control as they do without such.- The ultimate secret - tell to no  one: you can win the game by setting it to max speed and just waiting. The  ants will oust the reds, the humans, the dog and the lawnmower completel  without your supervision.This game gives you the illusion of being an  ant. It also gives you the feeling of how worthless a single ant is. Try  this game. It grows onto you.

This game was and is so hyped I thought it would blow its competitor at its release Devil May Cry 3 out of the water. It had decent action but no where nere the fun or variety of DMC 3 with annoying button combos to pull of finishing moves, this worked in RE4 when it was used sparsley and to make you watch cut scenes but is over used here.  Had it not been so hyped I would have given it 3 stars as a rental, but it is worthy of 2.

Good effort but !! .... although this game was outsourced to Shift (creator of that old DEVIL DICE), the idea was very good but it lacks still the humor and brightness of orignal creators of Sony for the highly brilliant APE ESCAPE on PS ....

While they have taken a name of one of the James Bond films, you do not play as Bond, but an ex-MI6 agent. In this game, take several of the James Bond films and put them into the same year, meaning multiple bad guys and characters are in this from different films, including Goldfinger, Dr. No, Miss Galore, Oddjob, Xenia Onatopp, Scaramanga, and a few others, including James Bond.Story: You are an MI6 agent. 3 years ago, you were shot by Dr. No in the eye. Since then, you have sought vengeance and resort to violence and brutality to get what you want. After an evaluation at MI6, you are dismissed and you accept an offer from Goldfinger to join his organization. You are given a cybernetic eye implant from Scaramanga (Goldfinger's Q wannabe) that is golden in color, hence your new code name GoldenEye. You are tasked with multiple missions for Goldfinger, but you find out you are betrayed in the end.Gameplay: You perform 1st-person shooter type missions in multiple locations throughout the 007 world, including the Dam, Casino, Octopus, Volcano, and many others. Your cybernetic eye is a weapon and you get upgrades almost every level from MRI to Telekinesis, and multiple hacking upgrades and a computer virus. You get standard weapons from the Bond series and you can use multiple weapons to get to your objective. You take on baddies such as Xenia, Oddjob, Dr. No, etc.Conclusion: while the game is fun and enjoyable, it is short lived and mediocre. The game plays like it was trying to build on the success of the original Goldeneye game on the N64. It falls short in almost every aspect, but being in the 007 world is still fun and all the characters make the game unique. A sequel was planned but soon cancelled from the poor sales and reception of this game. A game that goes through the various 007 world from all the movies does sound like it could be an awesome game, but this isn't what fans are looking for. Maybe on the Xbox 360 or PS3, they can make an RPG type Bond game that goes through all the movies, villains, locations, lovers, etc. Worth playing through once, but I didn't want to play it again. Almost no replay value.

This game was preaty cool. In the game you work for goldfinger and Odd Job versing Dr No. That seemed cool but it didnt fell like the other James Bond games as before. But what made me mad was when I heard you work for Goldfinger I thought you were going to be the villian but no that would make it to fun and thats not what they were going for. Also the graphics suck. But still it was a good game, like you get to use a goldeneye which you can use to fight people. I never beat the game I got stuck on the last level and thats because I have no patience. So if you want to try this game I suggest you rent it.

I was glad that I rented this game first before going out and buying it.With a name like "Primal",you'd think there would be alot of action,fighting and gorey moves(like BloodRayne). Alas, this is first and foremost a puzzle solving game.While there is fighting later on in the game(after solving three or four puzzels)it is not very fun.Using the shoulder buttons I thought was a bad idea,and the battles get very tedious.The story however is very good and a diffrent take on the wholegood vs. evil plot;Order and Chaos needing eachother for everything to exist.Both Jen and Scree were very cool characters that made for a funny team.On the flip side though,I never really cared what would happen to her rocker boyfriend "Lewis" (stupid name;maybe they did it on purpose?).I guess I'm sexist,but I've never really liked games were the girl has to find/rescue the guy.The graphics are top notch beautiful,and look very life-like.Bonus points went out to this game for voice acting with both Jen and Scree.I was shocked to learn that Hudson Leick did the voice of Jen,(actress who played Callisto on Xena) which was a nice suprise.And while I don't know the name of the actor who voiced Scree,I'm pretty sure it was the same person who did the voice of Vorador in Blood Omen 2.The game's soundtrack however failed miserably;mainly because there was hardly any music at all.The only music that is played is during the battles;and after the battle ends,so does the music...returning to complete silence.That might not be a bad alternative however since the battle music is Lewis's rockin' pop metal garbage.(I just don't like him)To end,this is a game you should definatly rent first.While it has some great suprises for a puzzle game fan,it is FAR from the best action game you could play.

I would vociferate this game as extremely irritating. The Radio songs are repetitive.The AI is stupid. The Radar is so darn small, your eyes start to sore. Most of the vehicles are Taxis and trucks.Getting from one island to another is frustrating. Overall speaking, this game is for those who have ample time to spare and do not get easily irritated. Most of the missions are epigrammatic, and gang members get angry at you on inconcequential issues.Its an extremely strenous task to find ammo.Well thats all I have to say.I would this game no more than 3 stars.Rockstar Games has to come out with something worthy. Theyre way better than this!!

Most of the missions are epigrammatic, and gang members get angry at you on inconcequential issues.Its an extremely strenous task to find ammo.Well thats all I have to say.I would this game no more than 3 stars.Rockstar Games has to come out with something worthy. Theyre way better than this!!
I haven't played this game but I've read the reviews from other gamers and I feel that this game is just a ploy to get the space war fans first before Star Wars Galaxies comes out, which from the reviews looks to be incredible and will definatly lay this game to waste.  SWG took the cake at the game show 1st place. I think anyone concidering buying this game should think twice and read the reviews for Star Wars Galaxies and compare them to this game reviews and see for yourself.  Save your pennies... its only around the corner.

This game recieved a colossal amount of hype, and from all the hyperbole, was destined to be as large of a step forward in gaming as Populous, also created by Peter Molyneaux.Instead, we have an orangutan flinging feces while peasants starve at the temple because you forgot to dump grain every 30 seconds.I am a huge fan of open-architecture games. I am very excited about AI in gaming on a philosophical level. I was profoundly disappointed.It is true, my animal learned. And my animal seemed to think. But, and this is the crux of it, my animal was EXTREMELY BORING.city maintenance was the essence of tedium. picking up trees one by one and placing them into the lumber depot = not fun. Teaching my pet to do this for me = not fun. Fighting other creatures = not fun.Additionally, encountering the level that reverese ALL THE TRAINING YOU HAVE DONE TO YOUR CREATURE = wiping it off my computer. I have heard that there was a patch to remedy that particular insult to injury, but I do not care. My creature was already damaged goods.So. If you have a friend who wants to hand you a copy for free, give it a shot. Sometimes your pet will be interesting. Some of the spells are pretty. But honestly, this is not worth purchasing.

The Medal of Honor games have always been great.  Until now.  This game should be a free download for anyone who still has Frontline.  It is short and the AI, as far as I can tell, is actually worse than in the previous game.  The &quot;Pacific Battlefield&quot; looks like a sandwich made out of doo-doo brown and mud.  Real pretty it is.  I couldn't tell much difference in the scenery from being down in a Phillipine sewer and running free on the beachhead (sp?)  The gameplay is a little tedious, as well.Maybe it is a good rental...This is worth about $10 +/-.If you pay $50 for this then I have a broken 32x for the Sega Genesis with no cables for just $200.  That's cash only, and this is a one-time offer.  Send all payments to:Raoul Drake515 Pensacola Hooker Ave.Shattaboulasuchi, LA 99999999-9999.Stay sober!

All defenders can outrun Messi and Ronaldo. Referee do not blow rough play. Two of my players against the goal keeper all the players behind i pass ball to my teammate and it's offside i guess they have invisible players. The game is very slow and you have to keep holding the ball and turning around to move. who ever changed the fifa 13 passing with this crap needs to be fired. Here is me using my goal keeper to pass ball to my teammate and he cant trap the ball.
The major problem I had with 2004 was that there were too many 5 star players in the recruiting process and the teams that performed well enough, inked most of the five star recruits.  The problem that created was that after about three or four seasons I began to notice the dominant teams that signed the bulk of those players were unbeatable.  By the end of your seventh or eighth year, there were anywhere from 12 to 15 undefeated teams at seasons end. I haven't played 2005 enough to be positive that this problem has been fixed, but from just the first two seasons, it definitely appears so. There are actually upsets in 2005. That's about the only improvement I can name about 2005.Another problem with 2004 was that all you had to do was draft a fast QB , roll out of the pocket, approach the line of scrimmage to draw in the linebackers and DB's and then heave it downfield to your single covered receiver for a 40 yard gain. I was left hoping that EA would fix the defensive AI to recognize and defend that. Did I ever get what I asked for!  Overall, 2004 worked offensively.  2005 is an entirely different story. My QB usually completes about 20 percent of his passes, and I can never rush for over 50 YPG.  Toggle the AI settings, someone suggested?  Even the worse teams will roll over my D and I still can't seem to complete a pass or run the ball, even with the defensive AI on the dumbest level.  Sometimes I can move the ball well but usually end up punting or turning the ball over in my red zone. On the highest setting, all my games end about 10-7, both teams under 100 yds total offense.  On all-american, I score all the points and accrue all the offense with Baylor while OU gets battered by my unforgiving "C+" Defense. When you come out of your huddle, the AI defense is ALWAYS in the right formation.  If you try to audible, the defense counters your audible before your guys even move!  So you throw a pass to a seemingly wide open receiver, here comes five supermans flying in to break up the play. You try to keep the ball on the ground, but the defensive linemen blow past your O line and are on you like stink on poop!  My favorite is when you're running a sweep or an off tackle and your FB is in front of you and you see a beautiful run developing.....only to have Willie, Mike, or Sam effortlessly run right past your FB and smack the daylights out of you ( Your FB doesn't even make an attempt to block). Or you have a great drive going and you penetrate the red zone, you get sacked 3 times and have to punt or you fumble the ball if you try to keep it on the ground.  Ridiculous!Defensively, there were problems that were a problem in 04 but are dominant in 05.  It doesn't matter what setting I am playing on.  I can hold OU or Texas under 100 total yards of offense with the Baylor (C+) defense, while their defense holds my offense to the same figure. In my first season, I Had the #117 ranked offense, and the best defense ever to grace the gridiron of Division 1-A Football.  I held a top twenty five team (don't remember who) to -63 rushing yards and 30 passing yards on all-american. That's just not fun to me.I have beef in other areas of the game too, but wouldn't be able to fit it here. Suprisingly, I think EA is on the right track with this one, but major gameplay problems are the hindrance.  I recently played NFL 2K5 from Visual Concepts.  A flawed game no doubt, but a good one nevertheless.  At the end of the game, all of the statistics and scores, everything, looked realistic.  If EA could incorporate some of that realism into this NCAA franchise, it would no doubt be the best football game ever made.

This game is of course awesome because... well, it's Madden! Madden football games have always been the best (except '94 &amp; '95 on SNES). Madden 2k2 has the best graphics, decent gameplay, franchise mode is the best, but the biggest problem with this and every other Madden on PS and PS2 is the passing.The passing is extremely difficult on every level except rookie. Even as the all-Madden team playing an NFL Europe team, my best receivers could NEVER burn their d-backs which had pathetic ratings of 66 or lower. If there is a defender within 5 yards of the receiver and the receiver makes the catch, HE WILL DROP IT!!! About 90% of the time to be exact. Even if he catches it and moves upfield (which is more of a fumble), he WILL be hit and the ball pops out. It doesn't matter what reciever (Rice, Keyshawn, Rod Smith) anyone and everyone drops the ball nearly everytime they are hit.Also the computer can be shut down for 99% of the game, but then at random cannot be stopped no matter what you do. They simply run right through any defense you throw at it. The computer seems to cheat on many other occasions with crappy recievers that can burn all-pro corners and so on.Anyway, it's still good, but I much prefer the college game by EA sports.

Despite the highly impressive introductory scene and menu screen, don't be deceived.  This game is far too conventional and undeniably sloppy.  Terrible low quality graphics and messy animation, lifeless paper diorama-like environments, corny cliched looped background 'noise' which fails to evoke a dark, haunting atmosphere.  The controls can become extremely confusing and frustrating in times of crisis (plenty of mutilation, blood spillage and cleavage wobbling though).  The characters are in many ways stereotyped and dull yet cheaply sexy and appealing (in the busty exotic bombshell type way - a cross between Elvira and Mortal Kombat's Sonya Blade).The concept and storyline (or lack of) is shallow and focuses more on show-casing stereotypical gothic style, lacking substance and depth.It's a shame, this game potentially could've been much better.  It certainly doesn't do justice for the X-box either...  It's still an appealing short-lasting novelty like playing old platformers for nostalgic value.  It's fun and wasteful but certainly not for those who want a worthwhile challenge.

A humerous, little-known RPG that parodies conventional RPGs.PlotYou are an ignored teenager, whose sister falls under a Pig Latin curse...and this dire circumstance forces you into the spotlight. Your Father calls upon the spirit of a bottle to cure his Daughter...unbeknowst to any of you, he has summoned forth Evil King Stanley Hihat Trinidad XIV, who reigned as the tyrant, Evil King Gohma, 300 years ago. In exchange for curing your younger sister, Evil King Stan possesses you, and orders you to help him restore his reign over the land. Thus, you must travel o'er the land, disposing of typical villain archetypes who have come to power during the course of Stan's absence. In the course of your journey, you meet heroes, scholars, princesses, and other RPG character archetypes, composing the stereotypical rag-tag band of outlaws. After all, you'll need all the help you can get...those evil kings aren't going to go down without a fight...GraphicsThe visual style is meant to be a tribute to that of Tim Burton, the guy who made A Nightmare before Christmas. Henceforth, everything looks Goth and Halloween-esque. The atmosphere can be described as "Halloween in every season but Autumn." So the atmosphere is BOTH cheery AND dark.SoundThe music is silly, but fitting for the backgrounds. In some cases, it is even good for listening pleasure outside the context of the game. They try to make the music sound Irish in places, with bagpipes and flutes. The sound effects are what you would expect to hear in an RPG, with some other humerous sound effects like the kazoo and such. Some of the fanfare themes sound like they were taken from the Super Mario Bros., and the Evil King Marching theme sounds reminiscent of Bowser's theme.GameplayThe battle system is semi-real-time, semi-turn-based, as you have ATB gauges, like in recent Final Fantasys, but once it's a character's turn to attack, action pauses, and you have to choose your attack before another character can. If you're not sure which action to have a character take, just select "wait," and then cancel that "wait" once you have decided upon a course of action.You can choose to combine your attacks with other party members (synchronize your attacks, thus more than doubling damage rather than attacking alone), or you can exploit enemies' weaknesses by casting spells of an element they can't stand.One greatly irritating thing about the battle system is, if your main character falls, it's an automatic game-over. In which case, make sure to heal your main character often, even if you think he doesn't need it. 1HP makes all the difference. This forces you to strategize.Enemies appear in the field in semi-real-time, semi-random way...enemies can materialize anywhere they want, but you still have to run into them before battle is initiated.Dungeons can be mazes, or large open rooms...you have to destroy urns and use magic circles to open gates, thus, dungeons tend not to be linear, a rather good move on the part of the developer.OverallYou're getting this game mostly for the humor, plot, or character designs, unless traditional RPGs are really your thing.

I love RPGs. The PS2 has produced some really excellent games for the genre including Final Fantasy X, the Shadow Hearts series, and Disgea: Hour of Darkness. Wild Arms 3 is not going to be joining this list of RPG awesomeness any time soon. It's not even going to be joining my list of decent RPGs. This game is terrible, and I just could not finish it! Trust me I tried and there was a period of two weeks when I couldn't bring myself to even turn the game on.I thought a western-themed RPG would be something really unique, but I was wrong. This has got to be one of the most cliched things I've ever seen. It's the third in a series that appears to be rather popular. I did end up hating this game, but strangely I'm not totally put off from playing a Wild Arms game ever again. Maybe since this is the third game, it's just an unfortunate casuality of sequel-itis.The Good:The music's pretty good. It's appropriately whistlely and twangy like the fare you'd find in most spagetti westerns and really sets the western tone.Fighting on horseback! This only unique from a visual point of view. The game still plays in exactly the same turn-based Final Fantasy-esque way as if you were on foot, but it looks really cool as you race across the desert fending off creepies.Save Anywhere! You can provided you have an item called a Gimel Coin, but luckily those are easy to find.The Bad:Cliched plot. It starts out with promise. Your four heroes meet up during a train robbery when some burly gunmen try to steal an artifact belonging to this Indian Shaman tribe called the Baskars. Classic Western! Then the adventurers, called Drifters, team up and take an assignment from the Baskar's head Shaman to awaken the four guardians of the planet Filgaia so maybe the desertification of the planet will stop. It's down hill from there. Suddenly, instead of a Western game, I'm playing a cliched find the four scared elemental crystals/dragons/betamax VCRs quest.... but with firearms! Soon our foursome discovers that this weird demon cult is out to infuse the planet with evil energy and transform it into a demon world or some other rot by using guardians and ancient artifacts. So they set out, to discover why Filgaia is dying and play follow-the-bad guys. It's almost like playing Final Fantasy VII over again, and I never liked that game much in the first place.Characters that come right out of anime central casting. The characters are very archetypal and never try to break out of their mold. You have Gallows, a ne'er-do-well Shaman, who learns some bland lesson on freedom, heritage, and self-actualization on the journey. Brainy, tough guy Clive, who might have been a better drawn character if his marital troubles were explored in more detail. Jet Enduro, surly anti-social amnesiac, and worst of the bunch Virginia Maxwell. For some reason they make her their leader even though she is the least expirenced of the bunch. She's naive, gulliable, and not all that smart trusting people she should know better than to trust and walking into obvious traps. She's one of those annoyingly perky types and her "Come on guys! Let's do our best for Justice, Truth, and blah blah" is more Big Bird than Clint Eastwood. She's also looking for the dead-beat dad she hasn't seen in 10 years. The anime feel is helped along by the video sequences (complete with corny songs) that sandwich the game when you begin and end it during each period of play. Trust me. It's frickk'n annoying after you've seen them ten times.Sandcraft battles. During the game you get a sandcraft vehicle. If you run into a monster in this thing, the way the battles plays out is very different than on foot or horseback. That's not good because they battles are so bloody slow that they can last for over five minutes each!The Ugly:Healing Items are hard to find. Healing Items are scarce, so it becomes neccesary to ration stretigically. There are some sections of the game that are so hard that having a big cache of heal berries is the only way to stay alive. It adds challenge, but since I didn't enjoy the game it just it that more annoying.Search system. If you want to find something on the map, you need to get directions first and move slowly across the map sending out some kind of sonar to make the ruin, town, or whatever appear. It's time consuming and also makes the game extremely linear.Boring Level Design. You'll send more of you're time trekking through the various ruins that litter the landscape. In the ruins, you solve various puzzles ranging from easy to what am I supposed to do here? difficulty. A critic once said level design was key, and Wild Arms 3 makes me see how right he was. All the ruins look exactly the same. I know I'm throwing a switch in the ruin in the North, but I did the exact same thing in the ruin to the South which also had a box puzzle like the ruin in the West.  Get my point? It feels like I'm doing the same thing over and over again. I'm not traveling to a Forest of Doom or a Cloud City of Eternal Happiness. It's just ruins and towns, and they all look the same!

This game is somewhat fun at times except for the special infected.  The tank, hunter, boomer and esspessially the smoker.  One hit is all it takes, it doesn't matter if you have full health, health packs, full ammo, super guns etc....one grab and your toast.  Your character (who can be lit on fire, survive explosions, fall from heights if you can without grabbing a ledge mid flight and be shot insane amounts of times with buckshot before dying) just lies there like a 10 year old girl and gets owned by the special infected.....it's pathetic and makes the game needlessly frustrating.  Your whole group could be knocked down, not dead just knocked down and if you get grabbed by any special infected the games over....that is amazingly stupid.  Why the hell can't your character fight back against these lame enemies?.  The temp. invincibility the zombies have is kind of lame, it's a glitch maybe but you shoot the bastards and they keep hitting you like your bullet magically passed threw them.  The tank teleports threw walls, not busts threw them just teleports as if one shotting you to death isn't enough.  Computer controlled Smokers tounges can defy logic by going around corners in perpendicular shapes or threw pinholes, doors, and walls.  Hunters can miss you with a pounce or pounce backwards in different directions and you still teleport under them and get owned.  Skill is not required or achieveable in this game, they will get you every single time.  When you get once shot you die due to the moronic AI players that stand there and watch you get lamed, it's maddening. The bots are cleptomanical retards that bust through windows, teleport through doors or walls, and teleport past you to steal every first aid pack and pills in the level.  They also walk in front of your crosshair most anytime you shoot, they open any door you close and end up just being total useless idiots.  I usually just gun them down and take their health packs when I need one, or they steal them using means beyond physics.  The harder the difficulty the more useless they are.  This game also has hovering molotov cocktails. If a horde is running at you and you throw one into it, the molotov will hover for a few seconds before exploding, ensuring any special infected are safly away from it and that your surrounded by "zombies" taking damaged before the fire kills anything.  I put zombies in quotes because these zombies don't eat people they simply pummel you to death with punches and kicks.  Left 4 Dead also has bloodthursty fire, yes anytime you blow up a gas can or throw a molotov the fire chases you, even sometimes when it's invisible it still damages you, maybe it's infected too?  The DLC was a total joke and made Valve look tired and lazy.  Survival mode sucks, you get a tiny blocked off part of a level already in the game, a crappy tiny lighthouse level all of which have an instant finale with endless ownage with baddies raining from the sky until you die.  Millions of Zombies, multiple hunters, multiple smokers, multiple tanks raining down on you until your dead.....wow so much fun to die in 1-3 mins in a tiny locked area when every special infected can one shot you.  The PC version actually has new campagins made by fans since Valve is too lazy to make them.  L4D II still has no dlc with valve again saying on the games release that they would support the games with dlc. L4D ii was a major step down from l4d which is flawed and glitched beyond logic itself.  If you want a real zombie game Killing Floor is the way to go its eons better and tripwire fully supports their games with new dlc regularly unlike valve which give you one extra short map and that's it.  Also no monster or zombie can rape you simply by touching you in KF when you have full health you can go down fighting. In l4d you sit there crying for useless clepto AI players to save you while they watching you die while gorging on health packs and pills.  This is a pathetic, retardedly glitched, broken, frustrating piece of garbage....trust be get Killing Floor.  L4D 2 builds on the same problems but just adds more special infected that only need to touch you once coupled with endless larger hordes....it's virtually unplayable.  L4D 2 is simply a 60 dollar update that should have been part of L4D 1 but valve say fit to abandon L4D after 1 half assed tiny DLC patch.
This game is somewhat fun at times except for the special infected and how the game glitches you into getting grabbed by them no matter what you do, skill has no place in this game. The tank, hunter, boomer and esspessially the smoker. One hit is all it takes, it doesn't matter if you have full health, health packs, full ammo, super guns etc....one grab and your toast. Your character (who can be lit on fire, survive explosions, fall from heights (if you can without grabbing a ledge mid flight) and be shot insane amounts of times with buckshot before dying) just lies there like a 10 year old girl and gets owned by the special infected.....it's pathetic and makes the game needlessly frustrating. Your whole group could be knocked down, not dead just knocked down and if you get grabbed by any special infected the games over....that is amazingly stupid. Why the hell can't your character fight back against these lame enemies?. The temp. invincibility the zombies have is kind of lame, it's a glitch maybe as this garbage game is obviously broken and unfinished but you shoot the bastards and they keep hitting you like your bullet magically passed threw them. The tank teleports threw walls, not busts threw them just teleports as if one shotting you to death isn't enough and teleports to the top of staircases when your running away. Computer controlled Smokers tounges can defy logic by going around corners in perpendicular shapes or threw pinholes, doors, and walls. Hunters can miss you with a pounce or pounce backwards in different directions and you still teleport under them and get owned. Skill is not required or achieveable in this game, they will get you every single time. When you get one shot you die due to the moronic AI players that stand there and watch you get lamed, it's maddening. The bots are cleptomanical retards that bust through windows, teleport through doors or walls, and teleport past you to steal every first aid pack and pills in the level. They also walk in front of your crosshair most anytime you shoot, they open any door you close and end up just being total useless idiots.

This is my last valve game, I refuse to pay 60 bucks for a broken, demo beta version of games with no support which is what you get from valve.
It is a good game overall, however, if you want a good creat of boxer this is not what you want. I for one WOULD like to have a decent creat a boxer. this one doesn't even beat The Greatest Heavywieght's creat a boxer.  They had to scan in people which to me was a total bad idea.I hope EA Sports makes 4 Major improvements on 2002 version.1.ALOT BETTER Creat of Boxer! maby a creat of manager/trainer/cut man. 2.Creat Female Boxers. 3.LARGER line up! 40 All Star Boxers my ...! Get back to the basics and allow a 30 rank Heavywieght league maby 34 so 4 other people can be on at the same time, and if they wanna pass you there gonna have to beat yah. and 4.

Sony gave it a good try but the game is too frustrating. The story begins with part of the Japanese landscape gone to Hell. The population has been turned into killer zombies called Shibito and you have to survive and find out what happened to the town. You can &quot;Sightjack&quot; so you can see through the eyes of the shibito, which is pretty scary, but you really don't care because as soon as your starting to get emotionally invested with your character you switch to another one. The accents do not fit the characters, and the color palettes used in the game a very drab looking. Be prpared to die and restart alot. Silent Hill 3, The Suffering, and Fatal Frame 2 are better choices.

I bought this when it was first released for the PS2.  I had high expectations due to its predecessor, Medal of Honor Frontline.  This game was a huge disappointment to say the least.  You start out sleeping in a bunk below deck on a naval ship in Pearl Harbor.  The Japanese attack, and you need to get to the top of the ship and fight them off while you escape.  So, the beginning of this game is not too bad, and I was mildly interested in the gameplay.  Then things went downhill.  I can sum it up with one sentence:  Before I knew what was happening, I was done with the game.  Yes, that is right:  this game is so short it is not even worth the $ price tag.  I beat it in about 7 hours, and that includes taking bathroom breaks and eating meals.Summary (out of 10)Graphics: 5Controls: 5Story:  3Gameplay: 2Overall:  3If you want a good military shooter, try Return to Castle Wolfenstein or Medal of Honor Frontline.

For the past couple of years I've watched Electronic Arts, formerly one of the most reliable game companies on the scene, squander its reputation with game after game filled with relentless B.S.  I gave it another shot with Medal of Honor Frontline, because it was part of the franchise I'd played for a long time and I thought, how bad could it be?I should have remembered that the last two Medal of Honors I've played, Spearhead (for PC) and Infiltrator (for Gameboy Advance), both sucked.  Frontline was the first time since Medal of Honor Underground that I played this game on a console.  It should have felt like home -- instead, it felt like I was playing Spearhead without a mouse.  What caused them to mess up the control scheme so badly, I can't tell.  But now your character aims blindly thanks to a touchy-feely right analog stick.  I've had to do much more minute aiming adjustments in Syphon Filter:  The Omega Strain, targeting distant enemies in the head, and I found it even harder here, though the enemy is just several steps away from me.  From the first level, I bumbled about blindly because foolishly, the game designers now rely mostly on sound to let you know where to go.  Not that bad a thing, except they botched the sound mix.  Rule of thumb in sound mixing:  Music and effects should never, never drown out dialogue.  Here, your superiors' instructions are neatly covered up in the gunfire, overloud music, and ambience.  From the beginning, I had to run around the beach while under enemy fire, looking for scattered teammates who were supposed to be yelling and waving at me to reach them.  Well, I can't hear them, and since there's no radar, I had to rely on blind luck to find them.  A very dumb flaw, easily fixable, but neglected.  Did they actually *test* this thing on real players?As with 90 per cent of games these days, the lighting looks good, and the music is great.  But once again, this game qualifies as a good-looking, good-sounding product that flunks its grade on mechanics.  I don't feel like I'm in control of my character.  Nothing is more of a drag than that.  I should've listened to my instinct and passed on this one.  I regret even the reduced price I'd paid for it .  Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor Underground were such classics, it's baffling how EA managed to botch it all up.

I thought this game was going to be just like SSx Tricky, but I was wrong.  I loved ssx Trickey levels, but ssx trickey levels are not that great.  If you want a good snowboarding game then get SSx trickey not ssx 3.

With this expansion pack installed, you will see some pets in your neighborhood. Once in several days, you'll meet not only street cats and dogs, but also some skunk!Having animals around is not always a good thing. You will have more things to do at home. Cleaning up their poo, bathing them, expense more on their food, etc. While keeping a pet at home could means more trouble, you'll have some advantages on them. If you have a dog, you can have your daily newspaper brought in your house by your dog. Or if you pet a cat, you'll see that cockroaches around the corner aren't there anymore (yes, your cat eat them up!).With this expansion pack installed, you will be able to pet a dog, cat, fish, bird, iguana, etc. When you buy a dog or cat, you can choose its colour and name it. You should buy toys and other tools for your pet. Of course you cannot make your cat sleep in a bird's cage.What is more, you'll see that your neighborhood is enlarged! You will have more lots to be built. Either as a house, or as a common place for you to visit (you can build shops, pets shop, etc)As I don't really like pets and I am disturbed by those wild animals around my house, I don't like this expansion pack very much. I would prefer buying another expansion pack for this game such as Superstar or Makin' Magic.

INTRODUCTIONDante's Inferno, a third person action video game by Electronic Arts, is based (very) loosely on the first of the three Canticles of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy. The Story is quite straight forward: Dante went through hell to save the soul of his beloved wife Beatrice from Lucifer.  In Dante's Inferno, there are nine circles of hell: Limbo, Lust, Gluttony, Greed, Anger, Heresy, Violence, Fraud, and Treachery. Guided by the soul of the Roman poet, Virgil, Dante fights and slays his enemies, consisting of demons, monstrous beasts, unbaptized babies with swords for hands, tormented souls, gluttonous living organs, gigantic gorging worms, etc., until he gets to the boss fight, where he slays the boss itself and descends to the next circle of hell.  The final battle is a boss fight against Lucifer himself.  In short, the salient features of this game are not the story, but the spectacular battles (at 60 frames per second) and the engrossing graphics--a vision of hell conjured up in the minds of the men and women at Electronic Arts.THE PLOT**Spoiler Alert**In the introductory cut scene, Dante was sewing a cross-shape tapestry onto his flesh, as atonement for his sins committed during the Crusade.  During an especially painful stitch, he flashes back to the battle of the city of Acre during the third Crusade on 1191, where the game begins.At the citadel of the city of Acre, Dante is fending off escaped prisoners wielding swords with a pole axe.  This battle serves as a tutorial of the game, where players can learn Dante's "light"  & "heavy" attacks, as well as blocking and evasion, together with running and jumping.  These skills come in handy in the soon-to-be "boss" fight with Death himself.  (PS2 players of "God of War" will find the combat system in Dante's Inferno familiar.)  Players should note that they have no control of the camera.  After his triumph in the citadel, Dante heads towards a courtyard, where an assassin sneaks up on him and stabs him in the back.  As life ebbs from him, he sees that Death rises up from the ground and condemns his soul to hell for his crimes during the war.  Refusing to accept his fate, Dante gets on his feet, pulls the dagger off his back, and attacks Death himself.  This battle is the first "boss fight" of the game, where Death teleports around the battlefield and attacks Dante with powerful and sweeping blows from his soul harvesting bone scythe.  Players who are fast learners will eventually land enough blows on Death, after which Quick-Time-Event prompts appear on the screen.  These prompts are controls players are supposed to pull or push.  By engaging them at the right moments, cut scenes pop up showing that Dante wrestles the bone scythe from Death, slays him with it and thus avoiding his fate in hell.Dante returns to Florence, only to find his beloved wife, Beatrice, slain and his home destroyed.  As he approaches Beatrice, for a brief moment, he sees her soul oozing from her mouth, before Lucifer whisks it away, for the sinister purpose of another attempt on the Throne of God by wedding a heaven bound soul.  Dante gives chase.  Lucifer dispenses an army of the damned to stop him, but, because he has the soul harvesting bone scythe, and a holy cross left behind by Beatrice, with which he can cast divine powers, and, later, a magic spell given to him by the soul of the Roman poet, Virgil, who is sent by Beatrice, he is able to destroy his enemies, pries open the Gates of Hell with a monstrous beast he tames, and follows Lucifer to the Inferno itself, where the main body of the game begins.**End of Possible Spoilers**THE COMBAT/GAME SYSTEMThe primary weapons Dante wields are the bone scythe and the holy cross, which serves as a range weapon.  When enemies are slain, their souls are collected upon Dante.  With these souls, players can upgrade Dante's abilities by purchasing special attacks and magic spells.  As Dante successfully slays his enemies, a "Redemption Meter" fills and a "redemption bar" is visible at the bottom of the screen.  When it is full, players can activate "Redemption" by pressing LB & RB of the Xbox 360 controller simultaneously, which makes Dante faster and stronger, until the meter is drained.  When Dante encounter a monstrous beast, he has the option of taming it (by activating a Quick-Time-Event) and commands it to fight for him.  Health is replenished at green fountains and mana (for casting spells) purple ones.  When Dante grabs an enemy with his scythe (after players purchase "Death's Grasp"), he can either absolve or punish his soul, which then fills the holy or the unholy meters.  When a meter is full, Dante levels up the holy or the unholy skill tree accordingly.  There are seven holy and unholy levels respectively.  Each level has unique abilities, new attacks, as well as a larger health or mana bar, for purchase with collected souls.  There are 32 relics hidden throughout the game world.  These relics improve Dante's fighting abilities.  At the start of the game, players can equip Dante with two relics, with additional relic slots available for purchase later in the game.  In addition, there are "collectibles" in the game world, namely, 30 Judas Coins, with which Dante unlocks souls, and 3 Beatrice Stones, which auto-absolve the damned.CONCLUSIONIn conclusion, this is what I like most about this video game: (a) spectacular and fast actions at 60 frames per second, and (b) engrossing graphics. This is what I don't like as much: (a) the combat system is dated (it is a close copy of that in God of War), nothing wrong with it, nothing innovative either, and (b) monotonous plot.
Yes cause he's f**king you over rather ya like it or not. The controlls are not very good but you know this is a bad game when your storyline is I stumbled upon a Dojo an old man says fight for me this was made when Shaq was with the Magic so the old man says you are the magic 1 so you fight a cat huminoid a boogger Sheets a dude from Aku Locka Polkistan a chick who uses voodoo guess what her name is Voodoo Beast and the boss Sett Ra a boss so stupid he would even be passable for a Killer Instinct character. M Bison and Shao Khan were better Bosses cheap but beatable and your attacks are difficult to pull off but everybody attacks you and there specials are more powerful this would have been a decent arcade game but but play it for 2 player mode and the bad 1 liners at the end of everty fight. Good game if you need a good laugh.

You know, pirates are all about sailing the seven seas, scourging and plundering mercilessly to retrieve your loot and stab your trusted officers in the back when orders are not fufilled. But Pirates: The Legened of Black Kat is anything but what you thought a pirate game should be.First off, the only real highlight of this game is being the captian of many ships and buying repair and weapon items. But even sailing them and doing sea battles is not that challenging and not that fun.You can also dock on many islands and many worlds as Katrina de' Leon, but even that is exceptionly bad. She does not have many moves or abilityes and heck, she can't even climb up the smallest hills!Graphics on this game are very poor, and all of the villians and chest items you retrive look horrible.

One of this games' many flaws is that it gives you no motivation to keep "adventuring" while you play and you don't feel like you ever want to plug it in after your done playing!However, there are little aspects of this game that seem interesting but not enough to keep you from being bored, such as Tiki Heads which give you different attacks, and magical figureheads on your ship to give it powers out of the ordinary. Yet even these items do very little to keep you wanting to play.Mostly, I kept wanting to see more variety of gameplay and challenges, as it quickly got repetitive, and the puzzles on this game are quick to solve.All in all, if you like horrible, poorly desighned laking gameplay in a video game, I sugest that you don't even glance at this game next time you come across it.It just plain is'nt worth it.
You know, pirates are all about sailing the seven seas, scourging and plundering mercilessly to retrieve your loot and stab your trusted officers in the back when orders are not fufilled. But Pirates: The Legened of Black Kat is anything but what you thought a pirate game should be.First off, the only real highlight of this game is being the captian of many ships and buying repair and weapon items. But even sailing them and doing sea battles is not that challenging and not that fun.You can also dock on many islands and many worlds as Katrina de' Leon, but even that is exceptionly bad. She does not have many moves or abilityes and heck, she can't even climb up the smallest hills!Graphics on this game are very poor, and all of the villians and chest items you retrive look horrible.

Sim Theme Park/Theme Park World are part of what I like to think of as "the Bullfrog trilogy". These three games (this one, "Populous: The Beginning" and "Dungeon Keeper 2", all from British company Bullfrog) all use a similar (spectacular) graphics engine and all fall roughly into the "real-time strategy" category. There is a marvellous aesthetic sense which pervades each of them.In STP/TPW, a sequel to 1994's "Theme Park", you lay down paths and theme park attractions, then open your gates to an ever-growing throng of youngsters eager to buy your burgers and fries right before going on a loop-the-loop 100mph roller coaster. (Vomit figures heavily into your equations.)Rather oddly for a theme park sim (though absolutely typical for RTS) you hire researchers who research advanced rides for you--not to mention advanced concepts like "the gift shop" or "the restaurant". With the right balance of attractions and staff and financial savvy you can change your! park from a travelling-carny level experience to a nigh-DisneyWorld extravagazna.Well, sort of. Each of the four parks has a specific theme and must stay within that theme. No Disneyland style division (Fantasyland, Tomorrowland, etc.) in a single park. Understandable given the strain that would put on the hardware--but unfortunate.Like the other games in the Bullfrog trilogy, there is considerable "well, that's cool" factor. And Bullfrog created a "downloadable ride" patch which theoretically could give the product some real legs.But there is even less actual =game= here than in the other two. And after you finish your first park, you'll find that you're playing the exact same game on your second park. And third. Every park has the same number and type of rides, sideshows, refreshment stands and miscellaneous objects.Playing is not unlike eating a huge cone of cotton candy: Sweet, but not particularly satisfying.It's also a good exa!mple of a product at cross-purposes with itself. There's considerable "toy" value in the game: It's a pleasure to build your park. Typical of Bullfrog games, the interface is clean, simple and rewarding. Experiencing the game from the first person is a real treat. But.Every moment you take to smell the 50-ft. high artificial roses (Wonderland park) is a moment where something is going wrong in your park. This is where the "gameplay" comes in, unfortunately.When you have grown your park to a good size, you'll be stopping whatever you're doing every minute or so to schedule repairs. Now, there's a simple rule: You don't run rides in the red, so you check your maintenance report and shut-down any rides that are going from yellow to red.Thing is, it's so mechanical, it would've been easier to just set a bar for the point at which the mechanics would go repair things. They could shut the rides down when they got there. (The way it works now is you have to s!hut the ride down and wait for a mechanic to show up, or drop one there.)This is true of the rest of the staff, too. They wander around their patrol areas, one presumes, because they don't have access to your big park map showing all the problem spots. And you can't stagger their break/work times, so they can all be waiting for an opening in the staff break-room while your park goes to heck.If Bullfrog had taken that out, though, there wouldn't have been much left to do except adjust the amount of fries on the salt. And, typical of the implementation of "business simulation", you have to adjust each stand individually as you build it (or flip back to a stand that has the settings you want and click the global setting button).There's the cross-purpose: Trying to make a business simulation out of it. Building a park at the micro-level is fun--managing it at that level is a chore.If they had gone the other way with the business simulation and allo!wed you to handle things like promotions, suppliers, unions, and lawyers, one of your pleasures could have been taking a break from it all to go to the park. (But that wouldn't really fit neatly into the categories that all games Must Now Belong.)Anyway, it's hard to actually dislike such a good-natured, easy-to-play game and there's a lot of fun here despite the flaws. Hence, three stars.

The area isn't exactly the fantacy world Jak and Daxter 1 was set in, that is one of my all time favorite games, everywhere he went it looked plesant, but this game is mostl building reuins, geto, and swamp. You have to check back in to the same location after each mission, and it's hard to find since everything looks the same, and when think you are about to find it you run into the sombody and a large attack begains; by the time you escape you have totaly lost your way again. Jak does have a cool hover board he can flip out at any time, and a laser rifel he can use to shoot the bad guys. I do like the hover vechiles that Jak can "jak" anytime they fly over head

I had HUGE hopes for Black and White. I love moral discussions, and this game had some of the best advertising I'd seen. One ad said something like: (good) Your loving wife makes you breakfast in bed / (evil) You eat it with your mistress. It made it seem like you'd really have these sorts of decisions to make.Instead, when you play, you have a cutsie little angel and a cuddly little devil, both making fun comments. The devil's comments are always promptly slapped down by the angel. The &quot;evil&quot; you do is more like Dungeon Keeper than anything else - drop things on peoples' houses, bug them if they're not doing what you want to do.You only get to start with a choice of three 'creatures', and these creatures have got to be some of the slowest learners on the planet. You tell one to pick up a drowning person, and he pops the person in his mouth and starts eating him! Eventually when they DO learn something, half the time it's not what you had been training them to do.The graphics are GORGEOUS. The whole interface with the game is beautiful, and lots of fun. There was so much potential as to how the game could have played, but somewhere along the way I think they got swept away in the graphics and lost track of what they were doing. Now dumb sailors tell you one at a time the things they need, farmers lose their cows even though there are only 2 to watch, and game crashes mean even things that work aren't necessary going to last very long.If you're a Populous fan (like I am) I'd get it just to see how far they have come, but don't be expecting miracles.

Some reviewers have suggested that the main problem with Dragon Age 2 is that it adapts the world of DA to the strictures of Mass Effect's gaming style, resulting in an unpleasant masseffectification that saps the playing experience of its uniqueness.  While there are a few small senses in which this is true (especially with the adoption of the dialogue wheel), to make this claim is to miss the mark: Dragon Age 2 is simply a downgrade from its predecessor in virtually every way.  If anything, we should be stunned that Bioware, a company which responded to nearly every criticism of Mass Effect 1 for its development of Mass Effect 2, appears to have completely ignored the feedback that they received for this series' previous title, Origins.Perhaps the most crippling issue--and also the most surprising--is the game's poor writing quality.  Dragon Age: Origins set the bar for clever dialogue in gaming, giving gamers an unforgettable experience.  From Morrigan's imperious jabs, to Zevran's lewd humor, to Alistair's goofy commentary, each character's remarks seethed with carefully crafted personality; even the Warden's speech options were routinely witty.  By contrast, the cast of Dragon Age 2 (with the exception of the suave dwarf brigand Varric) is uniformly uninteresting, wooden, and above all, angsty.  You'll groan as Anders and your brother Carver assail you with angry tirades about the mages and templars, sigh apathetically at the totally forgettable Aveline, and shake your controller at the screen in frustration as Hawke routinely makes comments that fail to reflect the options you select on the dialogue wheel.  Possibly worst of all, in a flagrant "screw-you" to Dragon Age's considerable female fan base, this game is utterly devoid of charming male characters to romance, and thus members of the Alistair fan club will find themselves scratching their heads in puzzlement.  One imagines that Bioware's real writing team went on vacation during the development of this game, leaving their collective pens in the hands of the Substandard Amateurs wing of the company.Yet all this does not touch on the second, and equally dismaying, element of failure in Dragon Age 2's writing: the plot itself.  If you were hoping to recapture the sense of epic, sweeping adventure that the lush fantasy world of Ferelden immersed you in during Dragon Age: Origins, then prepare yourself for disappointment.  Instead, as the Champion, you'll be trapped in the dreary hell-hole of Kirkwall, an unimportant city whose defining aesthetic feature is its statues of wretched, emaciated, shackled slaves.  There is nothing wrong about the choice of a "dark" aesthetic per se, which has been utilized to great effect by games like Dead Space, but what is wrong is that there is no corresponding feeling of risk or gravity.  No, you're not fighting against an oppressive force, evil demon, or diabolical tyrant--rather, as Hawke, you plod about aimlessly, wallowing in the general unpleasantness of Kirkwall, proceeding with documentary nonchalance as you complete an endless series of bitch-work tasks for needy and ungrateful citizens or teammates.  But for the occasional swarm of enemies, you might as well be playing Animal Crossing: Ugly Ghetto Edition.  There is no larger goal or driving motivation, no looming threat or call to action, and even the potentially-clever presentation of the narrative through Varric's interrogation is dull and anticlimactic.  ("So, tell me, what did the champion do next??"  "Well, then he traveled north, where blah blah blah...")  Moreover, the entire story is fueled by the conflict between mages and templars, which worked fine as a footnote in Dragon Age: Origins, but as the driving thematic force behind DA2 is nothing short of excruciating.(As a side note, I ask: What's with all the blood mages?  Becoming a blood mage was a huge deal in the first installment, like selling your soul to the devil--something really rare that evoked a strong reaction from people.  In this game, everyone and their dog is eagerly lining up to slit their wrists and summon sinister demons.  Seriously, large roving bands of blood mages will repeatedly attack Hawke's group for no reason whatsoever, and half of the quest arcs end with some character coming out of the blood-magical closet.)I'll admit that the graphics and combat of this game have undergone a significant makeover.  The lush visuals and fast-paced action of DA2 are extremely satisfying.  That said, most of the other technical aspects of the game have either remained in stasis or deteriorated in relation to Origins.  Your teammates' AI is routinely moronic, with healers forgetting to heal and characters bunching together as they're pelted by area-of-effect attacks.  The old cumbersome crafting system has been unwisely retained, if somewhat revamped.  The campsite has been eliminated, and to initiate group dialogue you're now required to visit characters at their own separate households, obnoxiously scattered throughout Kirkwall.  PC armor tends to be visually underwhelming, often leaving Hawke the least interestingly dressed member of his or her band.  Loading times are endless--a factor which I would normally overlook, except the individual landscapes are so tiny that you're hit with a loading screen every thirty seconds to three minutes.  These landscapes, furthermore, are reused, such that you traverse the same dungeons and environments over and over again for different quests.  Finally, the game even freezes from time to time; not ultra-frequently, but often enough to be annoying and mar the quality of the playing experience.All things considered, I have to admit that it's difficult for me to be objective about this game.  Dragon Age: Origins was an incredible experience marred by only a few flaws, and its sequel seems to have exacerbated those flaws while jettisoning some of its better qualities.  If I squint my eyes and imagine that DA2 was made by some obscure indie developer, I find myself thinking that it's good--not great, but merely rental-caliber good; perhaps a notch or two below the Fable games.  However, there is ultimately no escaping the impressive standards which Bioware has set for itself through previous titles, and as with a substandard Pixar movie or Zelda game, I can't help but judge this to be the inferior work of a creative team that knew better.Let's just cross our fingers and hope that the next Dragon Age installment will, like a Fereldan hero who slays evil when all hope appears lost, restore this series to its former glory.
The originalDragon Agewas a true masterpiece that marked gaming history forever. It was an epic cRPG that not only absorbed you into a world of scheming nobles, romantic witches and invading darkspawn but it was also an exercise in morality choices and balancing the clashing personalities of your companions. Following in its success, everyone and their grandmother is waiting to play the sequel (for some reason, the grandmother usually opts for a handsome rogue character). However, the question is this: does the sequel prove worthy of the original?Well, like an embellished Varric's tale, it seems to be a mix of good-news and bad-news.LEVELING UP (FINALLY) MAKES SENSEIn most cRPGs, leveling up involves adding points to strength, constitution, dexterity, intelligence etc - which, in turn, have an effect on health points, dialogue options, defending ability and damage dealt. By reading the manual you know what affects what, however, in most games, you cannot readily see those effects as you level up. Not so with DAO2. Every point added to an attribute will increase the derived statistics on the same screen.COME FOR THE LOOT. STAY FOR THE STORY - YOUR STORYYour hero, Hawk, lives during the times of the last blight, fleeing Lothering as it is burned to the ground.  Your decade-long story is narrated by Varric Tethras, a companion of yours. However, how the story will twist and turn is entirely up to your actions and choices.  The story will absorb you completely because it reaches so many bifurcation points that, in the end, it is entirely your personal creation. And, yes there are companions with...benefits here as well;))I am guessing blood-branding the bridge of one's nose will be the next fashion fad.THE FREE MARCHES NEVER LOOKED MORE BEAUTIFULIn a nutshell: you are not actually playing the promo video but the graphics are beautiful.The armor and clothes could use some more work in depth and texturing but the environments, the warrior moves and the spells look spectacular (keep in mind that said moves and spells will also start to look familiar after a while, especially since they look much more impressive than the actual damage they inflict - and have to be repeated again and again in every battle).What I truly missed though was the isometric tactics perspective! The camera does zoom in and out and it pans around but it is no longer possible to get a bird's eye view of the battlefield and plan your attacks accordingly. And this was not the only thing I found missing.FEWER OPTIONS ARE HARDLY EVER AN IMPROVEMENT IN AN RPGIn DAO I favored a dual-wielding warrior, building up both strength and dexterity, equipping him with both Maric's blade and Starfag and giving him all the cool moves of double-yielding.  Well, although DAO2 is hardly short in cool moves, it offers less specialization options in order to make warriors and rogues visibly distinct on the battlefield - hence a warrior in DAO2 cannot dual-wield.Do you find being human in a fantasy game trivial and prefer to play the role of an elf or a dwarf? Sorry, Flemeth did not see that in your cards: EA decreed you can only play a human in DA2 (and I am laying the blame on EA simply because something tells me it was a cost-cutting decision).Personal preferences aside, the number of abilities and skills has also decreased - and some, like coercion, I outright missed.WHAT'S NEXT, RPGs WITH EMOTICONS OVER THE NPCs' HEADS?What I also missed was real dialogue options. If, like me, you found DAO laconic, you will sure find DA2 almost, well,...illiterate. Sure, your hero now has a voice but did the dialogue options have to consist of such short summary-phrases that give you only the gist of what is to be said? And why did those options have to be presented on a (Mass Effect!?) dialogue wheel with...visual hints on the attitude of the responses available? More often than not, you end up saying a completely different thing than what you intended...Give some credit to your customers Bioware, we can read!AM I PLAYING A FANTASY GAME OR WAS I BEAMED TO THE BRIDGE OF NORMANDY?This is the first thing that hits you actually. Playing, and enjoying, a fantasy cRPG requires immersion - and the graphical interface plays an essential role in this. It was not by mistake thatBaldur's Gatehad menus designed as if chiseled in stone, whereasIcewind Dale'swere as if carved out of dark wood. The interface sets the mood of the game. Now, can someone please explain to me what are ...SciFi (read, Mass Effect!?) menus doing in a medieval fantasy game?Not only does one expect to find himself in a spaceship whenever the skills-tree or inventory menu is closed, but the in-game information is now displayed in smaller portraits with horizontal bars for health-&-stamina/mana. The portraits have moved from the upper to the lower left side of the screen; however, if opening up the screen for gameplay was the aim, well, they now seem to take up more space than before. Not to mention that they are harder to see.WHAT GAME AM I PLAYING AGAIN?Watch a gameplay video of the upcomingDungeon Siege IIIandDiablo IIIand try to answer this: can you really tell a difference in the gameplay? Sure, their stories and graphical styles are bound to be somewhat different but action games, hack&slashers; and RPGs seem to have merged into a single hybrid-genre of quick cinematic moves, looting, bartering, re-equipping and leveling.  And DA2 did not escape this.Whereas DAO had lots and lots of character, its sequel appears to have clearly favored style. I am sure it tested better on the teenage (console-seasoned) target groups - but I am also sure that said target groups did not include any RPG purists.(ALMOST) REASONABLE DRM ADDS EXTRA POINT TO FEALTYEA dropped the ball with the recently released and over-DRMedDAO-Ultimate Editionso, hopefully, they learned a valuable lesson. Going the draconian way of UBISOFT & 2K GAMES only manages to shoot your own sales on the foot. Surprisingly, DA2, although not perfect, sports a reasonable DRM scheme.The game requires initial activation (add half a star to the overall rating if this is not important to you) and it will re-authenticate every time it is run and it has access to internet connection - but it will not require to do so in order to run. In other words, once activated at installation you can block its internet access and it will run fine. Moreover, it contains neither disc-checks nor any form of SecuROM - at least not according to the official EA/BIOWARE announcements. Let's only hope this customer-friendl(ier) trend holds when the DLCs start rolling out...Initially I had rated the game at 3.5-stars game - and then rounded my rating up rather than down because of how much I enjoyed the series overall. However, as I progressed I realized that I could not honestly give this game more than 3-stars, pedigree or not.DA2 is a good-looking game that relies more on its stylish hacking&slashing; than any uniqueness of character and on the appeal of forging a personal story rather than following a deeper preset one.Without any hesitation, I would choose the original game over the sequel. DA2 may not measure up but it is still a fun game on its own, one that will stay with you long after the last blade is swung and the last spell is cast.

Let's only hope this customer-friendl(ier) trend holds when the DLCs start rolling out...Initially I had rated the game at 3.5-stars game - and then rounded my rating up rather than down because of how much I enjoyed the series overall. However, as I progressed I realized that I could not honestly give this game more than 3-stars, pedigree or not.DA2 is a good-looking game that relies more on its stylish hacking&slashing; than any uniqueness of character and on the appeal of forging a personal story rather than following a deeper preset one.Without any hesitation, I would choose the original game over the sequel. DA2 may not measure up but it is still a fun game on its own, one that will stay with you long after the last blade is swung and the last spell is cast.
On its own Dragon Age II is a decent game. Next to its predecessor though, it is a shameful product. It is a slap in the face to the series and gamers in general. Its only redeeming qualities are the aspects it took from Dragon Age Origins and speeding up the combat. Dragon Age II has improved its graphics a little and the gameplay is much faster paced than the original which I personally liked although it's harder to execute strategy with this technique. The story branches quite a bit which helps to keep you interested. The game stays captivating enough that you'll want to see it through to the end. That is about all I can say that is good about Dragon Age II.Dragon Age II fails in so many ways it's difficult to tell where to start. There is a ridiculous amount of backtracking in this game. In fact, most of the game IS backtracking. You will be restricted to a very limited number of areas throughout the entire game. These areas may change ever so slightly as the game progresses but not in any way that will make you feel like you haven't done this a thousand times before. Dragon Age II also lacks story. In fact, there really isn't a story beyond a sort of documentary style of storytelling of your main character, Hawke. The threats are constantly changing and there is no overall goal or main story arch of any kind which leads me to my next problem: the characters. With no overarching plot/enemy to deal with in the game it makes absolutely no sense for most of your party members to even be following you; especially the ones that tend to dislike your decisions. Throw that on top of the fact that most of your party members are not all that likable. Hawke is a great character but for the most part, the rest of his/her party is terrible You can load a save from the original Dragon Age Origins but it serves little purpose and really changes nothing.In closing, Dragon Age II was a sloppy, thrown-together mess. This sequel will not bode well for gamers who like a story that serves more purpose and has intriguing characters that they care about which is pretty much the entire Dragon Age fan-base. Even twitchy fingered, action-oriented gamers that this game tried to cater more too will most likely not enjoy this game too much due to the lack of environments and the awful amount of backtracking. Dragon Age II is a three star game ONLY because of the branching story and decent combat gameplay which I still feel was done better by its predecessor.PROS:-Improved Graphics-Branching storylines-Fast paced combatCONS:-No main plotline-Uninteresting party members-Way too much backtracking-Only a handful of environments to go to

Black and white is a very appropriate name for this game.  Some parts are really good, then they become repetitive and boring, and you soon realize that you just wasted your time.  I usually don't rate games low, so when I do it says something about the game.  I am almost mad at gamespot and other review sites, for once, for giving a game--that didn't deserve it--such a high score.  If you want to get a couple hours of fun out of a game then go ahead and buy this, but I would advise you save your money and go buy a better game.The gameplay for this game is fun for around 4 hours, then you get to the 3rd  level--oh and just so you know there are only 5 'levels' in the entire game--the game breaks down.  They take away your pet, who may I say is pretty stupid and just copies what you are doing, albeit in a very inconsistent manner and half the time just ends up doing more harm than good.  Once your pet is taken away and you start with such a small village it is pitiful, you then come to realize how much time of your life you just wasted.  The villagers in this game are mindless, they can't even make babies without you telling them to and when you do they always over breed.  Also it is almost impossible to be a good god in this game, my people would always keep dying and they were too stupid to even farm right.  The list of annoyances goes on, this is a lame attempt at being an RTS and it ends up falling flat on its face.The graphics, for the time, were good, though the people in the game did look slightly odd.  Also, I don't know if it was my computer or the game, when you zoom into things, like mountains, they start to mold and change shape as you get closer, a very ugly effect that I never got used to.  Other than that most of the spells worked fine and looked pretty good; though nothing was spectacular, it was solid nonetheless.The sound in this game is okay, though the first time one of your villagers die and you hear the "deeeaaatthhh" voice, it will take you a while to figure out what it is trying to tell you or whether it is another god speaking (which would make it much more creepy).  The sounds for the people are really annoying and I would rather have text than hear them talk, wait till you hear (or don't hear) the fake Irish accents, they are a pain as is the rest of the voice-over.  Other than that the sound is solid, with the different spells having nice sounds to them, from the rain to the fireball, that help differentiate one from the other.Overall this game will not give you any lasting value, unless you find this sort of cheap imitation of the RTS formula--with a tacked on pet simulator--enjoyable, then you might have some fun.  Lionhead is a company that promises and doesn't deliver; I hope in their next outings that they learn to make a great game, then praise it.

I've never been so disappointed in any game for the PS3 as much as I have been disappointed in Media Molecule's "Little Big Planet."  This was one of the worst video game experiences I've ever had in my life.Initially I thought I was going to love it because of the cool graphics.Unfortunately, they made it too hard.  One of those British idiots decided to only allot you 4 lives per section. But some of the sections are infuriatingly difficult, so when you fail them, you have to go back to the entire beginning of the level.  Why couldn't they have just given you infinite lives?  That way, the game would have been fun to explore and savor.  As it is, you don't want to bother collecting anything (e.g., the stickers) because there's no guarantee you'll survive the level, and if you don't, all your work will have been for nothing.And when you are bounced back to the beginning of the level, you won't think the graphics are so fun anymore.  In fact, this entire game has overtones of punishment.  The sad part is, this could have been easily fixed:  they could have either:1. given you infinite lives;2. given you infinite jump ability;3. made it so that your character can grab on to ledges and pull himself up;4. or at least allowed you to save and load from your last checkpoint, so that you can practice only the part you're not getting.5. allowed to you pay your unused lives forward;6. or at least had different difficulty settingsor something.But making you go all the way back to the beginning of each level was pure viciousness.  It's just torture with a cutesy face!  I'd like to meet the gamer who is agile enough to make it through the "Wheel of Death" in the "Bunker" level, yet who is excited about earning a "flower print dress" at the end.I don't mind games being difficult.  Lord knows I've made it through some pretty hard video games.  What I do mind is all your work being incinerated and not counting for anything and having to do it all over again.  Again and again.I suspect the reason Media Molecule set it up this way is that if they hadn't, you'd be able to finish this game in about 3 hours, so little content is there.  But making it so that if you die 4 times in any one section you have to repeat the entire level, this was a way, I suspect, of making the game last at least 2 or 3 days.And most of the time you die, it's not even your fault.  See, this game isn't 2D.  It's not 3D.  It's somewhere in the middle (I believe programmers call this "2.5D").  It looks like a 2D platformer, but there are actually three lanes you can be in:  the foreground, the middleground, and the background.  The problem is that, not only is it hard to tell what lane you're in in any given moment (you're not allowed to pan the camera about), but the game thinks nothing of bouncing you back and forth between these lanes without your having requested this, such as when you bump in to a wall or when you land from a jump.  So you'll keep dying on a lot of the jumping challenges because you can't make out where on the Z axis your character is exactly, or which lane your target spot is in.When I first saw this in the store and fired it up, I thought it was some sort of science game.  The kind where kids would play a cute character and learn about gravity, friction, temperature, whatever.  Actually, it's the complete opposite of a science game:  it teaches kids not to explore . . . exploring is not worth the risk, because likely you'll wind up getting electrocuted and have to start the stupid maze all over from the beginning.And here's the final insult:  the game claims that it saves your data "automatically," except that it doesn't, or at least it doesn't do it predictably.  I had serious problems with this.The day I finished this game, I had played it for about 12 hours straight:  straight from, I think, the Serpent Shrine all the way up to the Collector, whom I finally defeated at about 3:00 in the morning.  My games were not saved, even though I went back to the "Pod" several times during the course of the day.  After finally defeating the final boss, my save game only showed that I had made it up to the "Endurance Dojo."  Why did it save up to that point but no further?This was definitely not on account of my having shut my PS3 off at the wrong moment:  having experienced this before and having assumed it was owing to some fault of mine, I, after finishing, took great pains to exit using the circle button to get all the way back to your spaceship where it says "Use Pod Computer" so that it would definitely save the fact that I had finished the game.But even that wasn't enough to get it to save my game.  There's no way to force a manual save, either.  In short, the creators of this game owe me a completed game file, because I'm sure as heck not going to go through those levels again!  And I need hardly mention that the wankers at Media Molecule won't permit you to use another user's savedata file.  (I currently believe you have to exit to the PS3 and choose "Quit Game" for your data to be saved . . . still not sure, though.)Truly the worst game I know of for the Playstation 3.  I didn't have a minute of fun with it.  I regret every moment I spent with it.  I thought I was going to be treated to all sorts of eye candy but was just in a rage the entire time I was playing it.  My poor wife.Lesson learned:  avoid all titles by Media Molecule, or titles for which you can discern that Mark Healey or Alex Evans had a hand in making.  They make games evil on purpose and then market them as though they're for kids.Here's hoping Media Molecule soon goes out of business!  And may 10,000 camels poop on the graves of its programmers!
I really love this game. This game is the second best looking PS4 game to be released, only behind the gorgeous Killzone: Shadow Fall. And that's understandable because Second Son is an open world game. But boy does Second Son look GOOD, MAN!And the gameplay is there too. It's so fun having all those powers and running through a beautiful city. It's a truly great game and real fun.My problem with the game though is the terrible stutter and texture pop-in. And it's not just a little bit either, it's OBVIOUS and NOTICEABLE. I don't mind a little texture pop-in here and there, that doesn't bother me. But this game has MASSIVE texture pop-in problems. It's so obvious because the high res textures that &#34;pop-in&#34; are so much smaller than the textures that were there before. So it makes it VERY noticeable seeing something that big become a lot smaller before you eyes. And pop-in doesn't just happen every now and then, something big pops-in every 4-5 seconds while exploring the city.And I guess I can deal with the pop-in to a certain extent. But here come the stutters. Everytime somethings pops-in, the game stutters until the texture has popped-in. Which makes the game ALMOST unbearable to play. I still finished the game. And while your fighting bad guys these issues aren't that bad because your usually in one spot, so nothing has to pop-in. The stutter and pop-in only happen when your running around the city and new textures need to load. The problem is, your ALWAYS running around the city, unless you stop to fight a few bad guys or something.So overall, GREAT Masterpiece of a game that ALMOST get's ruined by texture pop-in and stuttering. All games have texture pop-in, and I never had a problem with it before, but this is just too bad. And to have the stutter accompany it just makes it WAY worse.I still recommend the game cause it's great fun. let's just hope they have a patch that fixes this.
One reason we got a PS3 was for the nice selection of games for it that you could not get on other systems.  Of course there were other reasons such as a Blu Ray player, free online play, and built in WiFi to name a few.  One of those games of course was Little Big Planet.  We watched videos on it, read reviews, and then made the decision to make it one of our first purchases for the PS3.Our expectations going into it was that this was a game for kids and adults where a lot of problem solving was required.  We had imagined a series of puzzles with perhaps various ways to solve them.  After all, we love brain teasers and puzzle/strategy type games.  The levels had a great style and looked very original.  Then being able to play with others online sealed the deal, as we thought that would be awesome.As advertised each level we played looked great.  The style was very cool and original.  The game play for what is was (while not what we wanted) was really well thought out.  Then to top it off there was a good amount of solid user content out there where the attention to detail was obvious that the creator spent a huge amount of time.The Character itself was neat with all the customization you could do.  For us that turned out to be our favorite part of this game really.  All sorts of different outfits and colors... heck you can even graffiti yourself.  Not to mention there is also a ton of download content on the PS3 store to take this to the next level.The game play however was not exactly as we were expecting.  Things started off very slow and we kept playing through hoping it would get better or more interesting.  Instead of puzzles, most of what the game consisted of was just running through levels, timing jumps, and collecting things along the way.  We kept thinking "Is this it?" and unfortunately it was.  For us it was boring and the game play reminded me of older 2D games like Super Mario Brothers where you just kind of run through levels, time your jumps, collect coins, and try not to get eaten.  Of course you can do a lot more in this game than Super Mario but it was similar game play to us.Overall we think this was a very well done game but kind of boring.  It feels more like a niche game rather than some huge "must have" that everybody will love.  It especially feels more geared toward children though many reviews on here talk about how much fun it is for them as adults.  In any event this game was just not our cup of tea nor was it anything like we were expecting.  We are holding onto our copy however so that our young daughter can play it here in a few years, as we think it will be perfect for her.

I expected so much from this title, but it suffers from the exact same problems as the first two MOH titles. They are as follows (in order of frustration level to me)Problem #1: Bullets come from absolutely nowhere... while this has been toned down since the "underground" installment, it is still very prevalent. Your enemies will shoot straight through buildings on occasion, and bullets will travel around corners as well.Problem #2: Every Nazi you come across is an absolute crackshot. I can sit there and watch an enemy through a thick fog in my sniper rifle scope from 200-300 yards sidestepping my crosshairs or running from side to side and hosing me down with a WWII-era STG40 automatic rifle (one of the most ridiculously inaccurate weapons ever made) with AT LEAST 70% accuracy at the same time- needless to say, this ends the level for me rather quickly. If I have a hard time sniping someone with a SNIPER RIFLE even though they are dead center in the crosshairs, they'd better suffer the same problem.Problem #3: Lt. Patterson is an IDIOT when it comes to weapons. He can squeeze the trigger, but aiming is another story. You should see "Operation Repunzel"- I am armed with a silenced pistol, getting hit from all different directions, and I can't hit a guy standing less than 3 feet away! The moron fires and a bullet hole appears in the wall behind him at least 45 degrees from the intended target. In short, it's ridiculous. A U.S. Army Lieutenant had to have been better trained in small-arms skill than this if he is to have survived WWII. Fortunately, he shoots quite well with a sniper rifle, but the machine guns and pistols are beyond frustrating.Problem #4: Realism. I never quite felt like I was executing a mission, but rather it seemed like a wild goose chase from medkit to medkit, absorbing dozens of bullets in my not-so-human body in between. This may have passed in the heyday of FPS's like DOOM, but today that stuff shouldn't cut it.Fellow gamers, is this what you think we should be getting from "the most realistic WWII shooter of all time?" Sure, the graphics, controls, and sound are great, but it lacks the flair where it really counts. Skip this one.

The makers of &quot;James Bond 007: Agent Under Fire&quot; made some missteps in their development of this Bond effort.  While still a very entertaining game with some levels that truly capture the imagination, &quot;Agent Under Fire&quot; comes across as a truncated mission.  After investing just a few hours in playing &quot;Agent Under Fire&quot;, the game is over and the enemy vanquished.  That may have been passable for older gaming platforms with less memory power, but it's unacceptable for a game on a system like the GameCube.  I encountered a similar aggravation when I played &quot;Rebel Assault II&quot; for PlayStation.  However, &quot;RA II&quot; failed to possess any redeeming qualities, while &quot;Agent Under Fire&quot; does.&quot;Agent Under Fire&quot; provides an array of fascinating gadgets and weapons for the player to use in helping Bond accomplish his mission.  There are gadgets like a laser for cutting locks, a decoder for getting past security systems, and even a grapple hook to help Bond get into out of reach places.  The weapons run the gamut from his famous 'golden gun' to the most sophisticated rocket launchers.  Let it not be said that Bond doesn't get to travel in style.  He gets to create some high-flying mayhem in his classic BMW.  He also gets to attack the bad guys aboard an underground tram system.  He even gets to storm the streets of some downtown European city aboard a tank and take out people, cars, and helicopters!Despite the shortness of the game, many of the individual boards are quite challenging and satisfying to beat.  Battles ranging from fights on an oil drilling platform to taking on a bad guy above molten lava to final mission in a remote, snowbound mountain hideout are quite a treat to play.  The weapons, gadgets, vehicles, and levels that one would expect from Bond are what make this game worthwhile.

- Operation Avalanche will never yield you anything more than a 3-star rating on any difficulty. There's not enough enemies to earn you the points.- Operation Varsity: your first encounter with the MG-42 wielding soldier in the train yard (on Expert difficulty) is nearly impossible to survive by making a run for cover before otherwise getting ambushed from all sides by the enemy if you choose to stay crouched behind the crate. That said, a five-star rating is extremely difficult to acquire unless you press ESC and quickly reload your last checkpoint right before you die.- The enemy AI is flawed - by this I mean they shake, convulse and twitch when you take the Springfield and zoom-in on static (not dynamic) enemy troops such as snipers or enemies behind cover.- Some weapon upgrades are completely nonsensical such as the faster holster-draw on the .45 pistol or the scope on the STG-44,..- The reload on the pump-action shotgun is ridiculous, as per each shot the gun is pointed upward to jack out the spent shell and load a fresh one into the chamber. It's poor form.- The BAR rifle goes from bad to worse with the upgrades as the zoom increases when you aim down your sights and the recoil already bad as it is that bumps the rifle upward making it that much more difficult to deal with.- The MP40 submachinegun after all the upgrades comes with a 64 rnd magazine but the Thompson's with the drum magazine only allows for 50 rounds. Before the 2nd upgrade to the Thompson's, the muzzle flash is a nuisance and unrealistic as hell unless you were firing it in pitch darkness. A 64rnd single-stack magazine on the MP40 is a goofy upgrade.- The last two levels of the game, every enemy soldier is packing an STG-44 which makes it nearly redundant to take something other than an STG-44 into these maps because there's no other ammo lying around anywhere save for a couple large green containers that will restock your supplies just once.These facts aside, at least the levels were unique and eye-catching. However, that doesn't allow AIRBORNE to save face.:

The Road to Rome is an expansion pack forBattlefield: 1942(BF1942). It covers the Italian campaign. It comes with 6 new maps and two new armies (French and Italians). These armies can only be used on certain maps. The expansion also has an assortment of new weapons and vehicles which again are only for use on certain maps. These includes for the Americans M3 Grant (medium tank) and M3 GMC (tank destroyer/mobile artillery), for the British the Mosquito (bomber) and the 25pdr (stationary AT gun), for the Italians the M11-39 Carro Armato (medium tank), and for the Germans the Sturmgeschutz (tank destroyer),PAK75 (stationary AT gun), and the BF 110 (fighter/bomber). Two infantry assault weapons include the British Sten SMG and the Italian Breda Modello 30. The maps are fun and fairly well balanced. I would also note that even though this is very old title there is still an active multiplayer community. I was able to jump right into a multiplayer game with no lag. However, there are very few servers that actually play the expansions.The biggest question is really is it worth getting. If you already have BF1942, I wouldn't bother unless you are a diehard fan.  But if you are looking at getting  BF1942 then getBattlefield 1942: World War II Anthologywhich comes with this expansion andBattlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII Expansion Packor getBattlefield 1942: The Complete Collectionwhich comes with both expansions andBattlefield: Vietnam.
The Road to Rome is an expansion pack forBattlefield: 1942(BF1942). It covers the Italian campaign. It comes with 6 new maps and two new armies (French and Italians). These armies can only be used on certain maps. The expansion also has an assortment of new weapons and vehicles which again are only for use on certain maps.

Secret Weapons of WWII is an expansion pack forBattlefield: 1942(BF1942). It comes with 8 new maps and two new armies (British Commandos and German Elite). These armies can only be used on certain maps. The expansion also has an assortment of new weapons and vehicles which again are only for use on certain maps. These include one of each of the following for each team: jet powered fighter (F-85 Goblin - Allies and Natter Rocket Plane - Germans), flying wing fighter/bomber (AW-52 - Allies and HO 229 - Germans), motorcycle with MG armed sidecar, amphibious assault vehicles (LVT-2 Water Buffalo - Allies and Schwimmwagen - Germans), commando rafts, specialty tanks (Sherman armed with T-34  Calliope and T95/T28 Heavy Tank - Allies and Flakpanzer and Sturmtiger - Germans). All in all the allied vehicle additions are the most affective IMO. However, the Germans got the best infantry weapons in the expansion. German assault troops get the FG 42, engineers get the Mauser K98 with grenade attachment, and most importantly the Gewehr 43 sniper rifle allows semi auto fire and you can still see your target (or what's left of them) after each shot. The allies get the Bren for assault troops, silenced Sten MK2 for medics, and shotgun for engineer. Of course, for those thrill seekers the rocket pack has also been added. These can be found hidden in upstairs rooms in certain buildings. I would have given the expansion more stars, but the new gadgets can only be used in certain maps.The maps are fun and fairly well balanced.

Battlefield 1942 - Anthology comes with the originalBattlefield: 1942(BF) game and the two expansionsBattlefield 1942 Expansion: The Road to RomeandBattlefield 1942: Secret Weapons of WWII Expansion Pack.  You can also getBattlefield 1942: The Complete Collectionwhich comes with both expansions andBattlefield: Vietnam. I'll talk about the base game first. I've had this game a long time, but never got around to playing it. I tend to enjoy single player games so Battlefield 1942 for me doesn't beat the classic first person shooter (FPS) storyline games likeCall of Duty: Game of the Year Edition,Medal of Honor Allied Assault Deluxe, andBrothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30. The single player campaign basically allows you to play the multiplayer maps in order with the computer AI controlling all the other soldiers. The gameplay is the same for both multiplayer and single player. If you get killed you respan at your selected control point, the objective usually being kill enemy soldiers and capture enemy control points in order to reduce their starting tickets (points) to zero. Even for multiplayer, I prefer more strategy type games likeCompany of Heroes. Some strategy is required for BF because while you have unlimited troops, time is limited especially if you have less control points than the enemy. Also if you do not play as a team you tend to get torn to pieces by your opponents.Some negatives: In single player, on maps with any pinch points, your teammate AI tends to get slowed down with vehicles doing circles (even with support to AI all the way up). The game crashes on me occasionally when loading missions (usually after playing several missions). You can't see if you hit anything with the sniper rifle as zoom in is removed when you reload. Check the reported kills to see if you hit or scan the field after you reload. Similar it is hard to tell if you hit with bazooka due to smoke trail unless you shift your position (kind of annoying if you cover doesn't allow it). There are countless odd glitches during combat especially around vehicles (these don't disrupt game play much though). Environment not destructible and destroyed vehicles and troops disappear (these items would take more memory).So what makes all these people rate the game so high. BF has lots of features that the other FPS don't have. BF allows you to employ vehicles in combat in multiplayer. You can jump into jeeps, tanks, airplanes, ships, artillery turrets, and fixed machine gun nests. This makes gameplay interesting. The other important feature in BF is the ability to specialize your infantry between assault troops, snipers, anti-tank, medics, and engineers. In this way you don't just pick up different weapons on the field of battle, you get to pick your kit to suit your mission or role. Each have their abilities and weaknesses, but as a combination they are stronger.I would also note that even though this is very old title there is still an active multiplayer community. I was able to jump right into a multiplayer game with a large group of other players with no lag.The Road to RomeCovers the Italian campaign. It comes with 6 new maps and two new armies (French and Italians). The expansion includes for the Americans M3 Grant (medium tank) and M3 GMC (tank destroyer/mobile artillery), for the British the Mosquito (bomber) and the 25pdr (stationary AT gun), for the Italians the M11-39 Carro Armato (medium tank), and for the Germans the Sturmgeschutz (tank destroyer),PAK75 (stationary AT gun), and the BF 110 (fighter/bomber).

The maps are fun and fairly well balanced. However, there are very few servers that actually play the expansions. If you already have BF1942, I wouldn't bother with the expansions unless you are a diehard fan.  But if you are looking at getting  BF1942 you might as well get them all if the price stays around the same.

Generals is moderately entertaining but it feels like I'm missing something. Unfair or not, the game will be compared to Warcraft3, Age of Mythology and of course the previous incarnations of C&amp;C.I only dabbled in Warcraft and was never drawn in the way many have been but I loved RA2 and Yuri and also have been exceedingly pleased with AOM. So what's the difference here?Well - AOM, while switching to 3D didn't drastically alter the mechanics of playing - but - the game play was enhanced. A great amount of depth and variety was added and they didn't simply rely on a new graphics engine to make it, what I humbly believe, is the best RTS available.Now Yuri and RA2 were pure fun. Generals seems to take itself a bit too seriously and while it is nowhere near a realistic war sim, it leans more in that direction. I find Generals to feel harder to control and I have less of a sense of how the units interact and counter one another.I've played most of the single player mainly because I've had trouble getting the multiplayer to work well so maybe I'll discover more in the game later on. But the bottom line is that while graphics are great to have, the gameplay is the thing. If that wasn't the case, then Civ3 wouldn't have a chance - and it is still as addictive as it ever was.And - I've also experienced some choppiness while playing and my system meets or exceeds the recommended system. AMD XP1900 w/GeForce4 Ti200 and 512 DDR PC2700 RAM. I would expect the game to run completely smoothly, but that hasn't been the case - at least not all the time.

Fun, sort of repeatable. Gets old driving for so long then destroying the same bakery or tv shop and choking the owner, etc. Not bad.
I have played a lot of war games and my father-in-law has been in WWII in pacific, Saipan, and some other really horrible places.  He agrees that while the overall scenes are pretty realistic, some of the gameplay is sorta out there!  The Bonsia charge is real.  But five planes attacking one sub and all making hits if you don't knock all the planes out of the air is a bit stupid!  Yes, the game does suffer from slow loading and it does have MEMORY LEAKS!  But all in all its not too bad.  Once you get over the stupid parts, the game itself is okay.  The people at EA need to calm down though.  Every scene is viscous and according to my father-in-law that's NOT the way it is...So, get real EA!  Get lean!  And Get RID of the darn memory leaks!  (I have 1GB of Real Memory and this thing with patch 2 starves for Virtual Memory, and I have 200GB of RAID Storage!).Want action?  Want SPEED.  Get Quake IV...!

I was very excited to try this game... The reality is that this game is sick.  What kind of a reflection on our society is it that we produce a game which glorifies beating old people with bats, running over cops, and shooting cops.  I am not against violence per se, because we have all grown up playing cowboys and Indians, or cops and robbers, pretending to have guns and shooting each other.  That has been going on since time immemorial, ever since it was cave dweller vs. bear.  Many games involve shooting or death, but usually you are on some kind of quest to save the world.  In this game, you are glorified for senseless acts of cruelty.  I do not find this amusing or even "funny."  After playing for a few hours, I felt dirty, as though I were committing evil.  If you pretend to ...[commit crimes], that is not a good thing.

The game starts off with an intersting opending and quickly goes down hill from there. As soon as Jak opens his mouth to speak, I began to have my doubts. Everything he says he is nasty and his vocal tones are those of the nastiest villians. Granted he is supposed to be under the influence of dark forces and he is grumpy from two years of torture, but still he sounds more like a stock villian then a hero whose fate you are supposed to care about it.The level designs are also unrelentedly difficult. From the very beginning you are faced with challenging moving platforms and with a couple of levels you will be chased by a relentless cannon while jumping blind repeatedly. Poor camera angles, lack of camera control in crucial areas, make already difficult jumps nearly impossible as judging depth is often not possible  and more often then not you are forced to jump blind because you can not see where you need to go next.Rarely is there is no time to pause to study your move and try to rotate the camera (which at some crucial spots simply refuses to budge) because crumbling ledges, firing cannons and their ilk force you to keep hopping from one awkward ledge to the next. You will be forced to endless repeat difficult segements, memorizing the exact route as you will often need to jump blind in order to complete levels. Finely you make it through a difficult segement only to fall off a tiny ledge that lures you off the side by tempting goodies, or shot by an unseen gun, only to be sent bake to the beginning, forced to repeat what you thought mastered until you eyes blur over and you forget why it is you are playing the game. Only sheer stuborness will force you to continue.When you are not being frustrated by the pooly paced and un-balanced levels, you will be bored by the endless travel by foot or awkward vehicals that you can steal, needed to get between levels, which the game refers to as missions. This aspect of the game might have been amusing as a single section but is otherwise pointless. The vehicals can only be flown at two heights and there is little room to manuver. Everyone just bangs into everyone else. It is like an endless game of bumper cars to get from one place to the other.Eventually, if you persist, you will realize that both the level difficulty and endless crisscrossings of the hub city to get to each level are only there to pad out what otherwise be a very brief game. It's a shame really, because the story is interesting, the levels bright and intriguing and with just a bit of tuning could have been really fun rather then really frustrating. If ND really wanted to be innovative, there would have a variable level of difficulity and maturity settings. As it is this game will only appeal to the teenager or adult who finds most platforms a piece of cake and longs for a real challenge.

I'm going to forego my usual in-depth reviews for this game. We all know what Twisted Metal is and this is nothing more than a rehash of those same games. Here's why:Pros:Excellent GraphicsCool Mini-moviesEndurance & Challenge levels are interestingGood to pass time withCons:Short game with small levelsRepetitious gameplayBoring endings to each characterSame old rehash of earlier TM gamesNot enough "total-destruction" of buildings and such for this type of game.If you want to be "burned-out" by a game, I recommend "Burnout, Test Drive, and Twisted Metal: Black." Not worth the money. A renatal at best.

In the varied and overcrowded plateu of first-person games, it's always  nice to see someone try to break away from the mold, but unfortately,  System Shock 2 comes a little too late.  Having missed the chance to beat  Half-Life to the punch, this game is a fun play, but one best borrowed from  a friend.

Ingredients you will need:1 part Streets of Rage1 part Final Fantasy2 Large cups of Middle EarthPinch of Street-FighterAssorted Eye-CandyHot on the tails of most audacious and glorious movie adaptations of all time comes this little slice of action from Electronic Arts.  Like most people I came out of the movie theatre with sweaty palms and a strong desire to stab goblins, and luckily this little game is right up my ally.Playing as either 'designer-stubble king-to-be' Aragorn, half-pint, salt of the earth axe murderer Gimli or clean-cut Robin Hood crack-shot Legolas, you'll tramp around assorted Middle Earth locals, hitting things with your sword or shooting them with your bow.  If you're at all familiar with the Streets of Rage or Double Dragon games you'll be right at home here.The levels are right out of the movies, with of course a few artistic liberties taken in expanding them to a scrolling slash-em-up.  Expect Fanghorn Forest, Helms Deep and the wonderfully evocotive Balin's Tomb from the first movie.Bad guys arrive thick and fast in all your favourite flavours - Orks, Moria Goblins, big tough Uruk-Hai and of course the Ring Wraiths.  Your options in dealing with all of them generally involves hammering different button combinations in order to produce a variety of flashy sword moves and colourful special moves.However, this is really the crux of why The Two Towers game isn't going to set the world on fire.  Most of your moves are gained by completing a level with a high point score, so you'll find yourself replaying levels again and again just to up your score and buy that all important new 'goblin slaying thrust' move.  The moves themselves are pretty simple, but you'll be hard pressed to get them right when you most need them, swamped as you are in enemies.  To the game's credit, you will see a LOT of enemies on the screen at once, but sometimes its all a bit much.The graphics and sound are top notch and very realistic, but if only you could do a bit more exploring, a bit more strategic planning of your next attack and a bit less hammering X every time 50 goblins hove into view.  And most criminal of all, if only you could play with a friend.  More than once you'll be wishing you could team up with your mates against the lumbering cave troll.  The game AI handles all of your allies, but make no mistake, its you that's gonna do all the dirty work.In the short term this is a good, solid hack-and-slash romp, with great visuals and lots of bonus features to explore.  But at the end of the day you'll be wishing there was just a little more beneath the beautiful surface.  Roll on Return Of The King...

It's 2013 and I found this PS1 title going for a really cheap price, so I figured what harm could it do to try it? I loved Duke Nukem 3D on PC, and even found it surprisingly great on the N64 in Duke Nukem: Zero Hour. So it puzzles me why it's taken me this long to try another Duke title?Duke Nukem returns to kick some arse and chew bubble gum, and he's all out of gum! This game is simmilar in style to that of Zero Hour, it's taken away the First Person perspective of Duke Nukem 3D, however there is a code to unlock 1st person view for those interested. This time around Duke has been called in to save a world full of babes from an alien invasion by some monkeys and pigs, as well as a few other alines and what not. Typical Duke action as you battle your way through environments until you reach your save point/end of level marker. You blow away the bad guys, spill some alien guts and listen to Duke be a smartarse about it all.Weaponry this time introduces a few old classics and a few new ones, as well as some revamped older ones. Quite frankly, I miss the original RPG and Machine Guns, but it is fun now to use the new RPG which is more like Duke is holding the scope from a submarine to launch them, as well as flamethrowers, lasers, plasmas, shrink rays and what not.As usual, for those who are wussies, there are plenty of codes that can be unlocked for invincibility, infinite ammo, level select and much more. There is a few worlds to explore, and the environment feel right for a Duke Nukem battle. However, at times, there feels like there is not enough enemies... even on the hardest difficulties, it just makes them harder to kill, not more of them coming at you. I found the controls to be a bit wonky at times, but not enough to effect gameplay itself. I guess it just takes a few minutes to adjust to, but I would have much preffered using both analog sticks to roam around and look in whatever direction, instead you have to get used to the upper-mid directions of the one stick being how you look around... or hold R1 to aim around.Overall, not as classic a game as Duke Nukem 3D, of coarse, none of them ever will be. I didn't quite enjoy it as much as Zero Hour, that game will be hard to top. But it's better than... well, I haven't played Time To Kill or the other Ps1 title yet, so I guess I can just say it's better than Duke Nukem and Duke Nukem 2 for now, if you even knew those two side scroller games even existed.Still, none the less. A pretty good effort in the Duke Nukem series. Definitely feels like it's PS2 graphics, so don't expect more... anyway, Hail to the King baby.

I've been playing FFXI for around a month now, and I have had mixed feelings on the game. This review is my opinion, so many will probably disagree with some of the things I will say in it. First off, I'll admit I love FF's, but for this review I won't let that alter what I think of the game (i.e. no automatic 10).Here's some background info, in case some people don't already know:FFXI is set in Vana Diel, a world infested with varying monsters and contains many interesting places. There are 5 races, which are Hume, Galka (male gender only), Mithra (female gender only), Elvaan and Taru Taru. In the beginning you are asked to chose your home town out of 3 choices: San D'oria, Windurst and Bastok, each one being totally unique. The core of the game is lvling up to fight increasingly difficult monsters and bosses, but there are many more other elements to the game, including missions and a guild system. Of course this is a very brief intro to the world of FFXI, but I don't want to go into too much detail in this review.GAMEPLAY - To me the most defining aspect of a game. This is where FFXI either succeeds or fails, depending on your viewpoint. At first I couldn't wait to lvl up and get into PT's. Soloing after around 6 got a bit dull, but it had to be done to enable me to PT with others, so I persevered until 11, where the fun really begun. Before 11, when someone asked me to PT, I usually took it as just me and that person, going around killing some things together and exploring some areas. But at 11, the game took a dramatic turn. For the first time I was getting into big PTs, ones with 6 people in them, and ones that involved strategies and careful planning. The new areas and new monsters were fascinating, and every minute was enjoyable (even resting after a fight!).However, this excitement was to change. After a few days in Jeuno, you realise this is what it's gonna be most of the time. Waiting for a PT (which could take 5 minutes to 2 hours depending on the situation), then going out to fight the same monsters for around 70-200 exp. The problem was how long it took to get up to a lvl. At lvl 28, it takes 5600 exp to lvl up (I think). Just imagine how long that would take...Money making is extremely tedious, and I believe the whole idea needs to be re-assessed by Square, as it is just plain dull. You may find it enjoyable, and you could try the guild systems, but they could turn out to be a little profit, or no profit at all...Missions aren't too varied enough for me, and I know there are harder ones later on, but essentially they are "postman" missions; get this, go there, kill that, go back, go somewhere else and so on.In addition, many of the games dynamics need a serious re-think, as I discovered many flaws from one of my friends in the game, and also from my experiences.All in all, the gameplay could potentially be great if you like this type of thing (which I know a lot of people do), or it could be quite low. Personally, I would give it a 7.GAMEPLAY verdict: 7STORY - For an MMORPG, I believe this has a very good story. Even compared with other games of different genres, FFXI's story still remains good. The main story progresses through Missions, which show cut-scenes detailing the story and explaining why you are doing this particular task in a Mission.As this is a MMORPG, you essentially "make" your own story, by living out in this world through your character. You experience different things and explore many areas, making friends throughout the world. Many memories will be unforgettable, and as FFXI also has a decent storyline as well as your own "life", I would give it a 9.STORY verdict: 9LOOKS - The detail is usually amazing, and the monsters look great, as do the character models with the varying equipment. Magic spells look OK, but not too special. Some areas do look bland, but the towns more than make up for it.LOOKS verdict: 9SOUND - I don't really think the music is anything special, and the sound effects are what you would expect from this type of game - groans when you slash and take hits, magic sound effects, etc. None of the music really stays with me, like many other games like FF8 and MoH.SOUND verdict: 7LENGTH - MMORPGs are meant to last, and I believe this is no exception. There are many things to do in the game, with tonnes of lvls to get, but you could become easily bored with the game, depending on what you look for in a game.LENGTH verdict: 9Overall I like FFXI, but it really doesn't capture me as much I was expecting. It's a good game, but I wouldn't call it an absolutely great game, as I don't like a game where you need a LOT of patience, and virtually no skill.I give it a 7.8

SingStar Pop is a karaoke game, featuring 30 songs and 6 medleys from some of the world's most popular artists. Beyond the traditional lyrics-at-the-bottom of the screen, this karaoke game also uses pitch and timing bars. SingStar offers 3 levels of difficulty, several Party and Multiplayer games as well as a Freestyle and Single Player mode. The game is available as a bundle with 2 Microphones for only $49, which is a great deal no-matter-what, or without the mics for $30. The game works interchangeable with SingStar Rocks (Released in November 2006), and it even allows players to switch between discs without exiting the game or powering down the PlayStation. Tweens, Teens and Adults will have a blast as they sing "with" and "against" each other on their PlayStation 2 or PlayStation 3. We can assure you that SingStar Pop is a well-designed game, however a game like this will "make it" or "break it" based on how you like the song list. To find out see the full list below.Artist / Song Title3 Doors Down / Kryptonite&#8232;A-Ha / Take On MeAlicia Keys / Fallin'All American Rejects / Move Along&#8232;Ashlee Simpson / Invisible&#8232;Avril Lavigne / Sk8er Boi&#8232;Blue October / Hate Me&#8232;Britney Spears / ...Baby One More TimeCartel / Honestly&#8232;Cyndi Lauper / Girls Just Wanna Have Fun&#8232;Daniel Powter / Bad Day&#8232;Destiny's Child / Survivor&#8232;Franz Ferdinand / Take Me OutGorillaz / Feel Good, Inc.&#8232;Hinder / Lips of an Angel&#8232;Hoobastank / The Reason&#8232;James Blunt / You're Beautiful&#8232;Jesse McCartney / Beautiful Soul&#8232;Lifehouse / Hanging By A Moment&#8232;My Chemical Romance / Helena&#8232;Natasha Bedingfield / These Words&#8232;Panic!

SING A SONG:I enjoy all of the Karaoke Revolution games (see my American Idol version review, on this website) and decided to try Singstar Pop because this year's songs are some of my favorites. I listened to parts of all the songs in last year's game (Singstar Rocks) on the Singstar website and disliked many of the songs, so I didn't buy it.It's all just a matter of personal taste though, so if you really liked last year's song selection, chances are you'll only like about five to ten of this year's 30 songs and probably think that they should've added an extra "o" in between the two "p"'s of Pop, to better describe the song selection. I, however, like about 22 of them, especially Snow Patrol's "Chasing Cars", or as I often call it, "If I Lay Here".The game can be played by 1-8 players and both last year's microphones and this year's microphones are exactly the same. Again, they can only be used with Singstar games and thus can't be used with any of the Karaoke Revolution games, nor can the Kar. Revolution microphone be used with the Singstar games.NOTE: For those of you that already have, or are planning to get a Playstation 3 console in the near future, you should skip this PS2 version and instead buy the PS3 version of Singstar, when it's released sometime near the end of the year. It's the only way you'll then be able to download over 350 music videos to sing along to, whereas PS2 owners will have to settle for just the 30 songs listed below.The 30 songs included in Singstar Pop (U.S. version) are:3 Doors Down "Kryptonite"A-Ha "Take On Me"Alicia Keys "Fallin'"All American Rejects "Move Along"Ashlee Simpson "Invisible"Avril Lavigne "Sk8er Boi"Blue October "Hate Me" (EDITED)Britney Spears "...Baby One More Time"Cartel "Honestly"Cyndi Lauper "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"Daniel Powter "Bad Day"Destiny's Child "Survivor"Franz Ferdinand "Take Me Out"Gorillaz "Feel Good, Inc."  (EDITED)Hinder "Lips of an Angel"Hoobastank "The Reason"James Blunt "You're Beautiful"Jesse McCartney "Beautiful Soul"Lifehouse "Hanging By A Moment"My Chemical Romance "Helena"Natasha Bedingfield "These Words"Panic! At the Disco "I Write Sins, Not Tragedies"  (EDITED)Rihanna "SOS"Ryan Cabrera "On The Way Down"Snow Patrol "Chasing Cars"The Clash "Should I Stay or Should I Go"The Fray "Over My Head"The Raconteurs "Steady, As She Goes"U2 "Vertigo"Whitney Houston "I Wanna Dance With Somebody"Only three of the music videos have swear or drug related words that are either glitched or edited out. They are: Blue October's "Hate Me"; Panic at the Disco's "I Hate Sins Not Tragedies" and the Gorillaz "Feel Good Inc." (Note: Since James Blunt's "You're Beautiful" uses the video with the words "FLYING high" in the lyrics, rather than the cd version's "bad F" word, there was no need to do any censoring for this music video.)There is nothing to unlock in the game so right away you get all 30 of the widescreen, real artist music videos that are used seamlessly in the game. The loading is also super fast! Once you pick a song, you can start singing it within five seconds or so. Very nice!In addition to the 30 songs, you can choose from six different song medleys. They are as follows: Random; Pop Chicks; Pop Dudes; All American Indie; International Hits and Party On. Each of the specific medleys always include the same five songs (except for Random, of course). For example, the Pop Chick medley (2:30 in length) always includes "Survivor", "These Words Are My Own", "Invisible", "Fallin'" and "Baby One More Time". It's done this way since your high scores are also saved for each of these medlys (except for Random).Unfortunately, after turning on my stereo and hearing no sound coming from my two rear surround speakers except for a bit of my own voice, I realized that ALL the songs sound like either very poor stereo or even mono recordings. They're obviously not encoded with any simulated surround cabability like all the amazing cd quality sounding songs of the Karaoke Revolution games are. If the Singstar songs were of cd quality I would have given the game 4 stars because I still enjoy it and do find it to be a refreshing change (from Kar. Rev.) to hear the real artists and see the actual music videos.If you just use your Tv set to listen to the songs you won't notice any problem with the still clear sound quality of each song. Although, I decided to use my discman head phones (plugged into my stereo) while playing the game so that at least it's easier to escape into these less than cd quality sounding songs. I found that my scores are better in both Singstar and Kar. Rev. whenever I use my head phones anyway, and I feel more involved with the songs this way.GAMEPLAY:Although you can't shut off the real singer's voice while you sing (unless you use the eyetoy), you can however, use the L1 and L2 buttons to raise and lower the microphone volume so that it's easy to still hear your voice. What's even cooler is that you can playback the song you just sung and either pause, FF or Rewind it, at any time, as well as saving it to a memory card (uses about 550-700 MB per song).On playback, you only see the music video and not your score or note bars to see where you went wrong but it's still an amazing feature even with some occasional, mostly minor, distortion that might occur. You can even add sound effects like making yourself sound like a robot or a baby on helium,add vibrato or reverb and alter or remove them at ANY time.The game plays very much the same way as Kar. Rev. except that the lyrics don't scroll across the screen from left to right but rather stay in the middle (underneath the video) and a blue bar slowly approaches the lyrics to let you know when to start singing. In Singstar, the scoring method seems a bit more complicated and I'm not a fan of the extra Rap meter that briefly appears during a rap sequence in some songs.However, I do really like the way your blue pitch notes (or red ones for player 2) stay on the screen for the entire phrase, so it's easier to see where your pitch was, and how far from the desired pitch you were, at a specific point in that phrase. You can even see the gaps where you incorrectly stopped singing. It's all nicely done and adds to the overall experience. Also, if you sing a phrase close enough to perfect you'll see the word "Cool" appear, which is equivalent to Kar. Rev.'s, "Great" rating.You can play without being scored in the "Freestyle" mode (for 1-2 players) and you can even remove the note bars if you don't want the videos to be cluttered with them. However, the lyrics underneath the video can't be removed.The game will also save your various high scores (even your medly scores-except for Random medly). It will show the difficulty level and whether you sang the short or normal versions of the song, but it doesn't show you the dates you set them on or the cute name ranking you got with your score, such as: Amateur,Wannabe, Hopeful, Lead Singer, Rising Star, Superstar or Singstar.There are three difficulty levels, but even on the easiest level, it's tough to improve your score once you get into the 9,000 point range (perhaps 10,000 is the top score?) because even if you miss just a few notes per phrase it will seriously keep you from improving. It's easier in Kar. Rev to improve scores because they range on average from 10,000 to 50,000 points, with some big swings possible as you improve.With Singstar however, after just one week of playing, the odds of improving your best score would most likely be very small. Still, I love singing "Chasing Cars", even in mono, so it's still something I'll play every month most likely and if you like singing karaoke and already have played Kar. Revolution, you might as well at least rent this to see if you're okay with the less than cd quality of the songs.Yes, you can play this game by yourself  (in "Sing Solo" mode), but because it has no career mode, you'll most likely also end up playing in "Party" mode (for 2-8 players). You'll get the same kind of choices as in the Karaoke Rev. games such as: Battle, Medley, Duet, First to Post (first one to get to specific point total wins), Keep it Up (must keep performance bar above the marker or song ends) etc.Obviously, the real replay value for most people will be in the playing against others, so go ahead and Party On!
I could understand Guitar Hero and Rock Band not having any non Rock & Roll songs.  But SingStar has no excuse with this kind of song selection since it is being marketed as a Karaoke Game.No Motown, no classics, just bunch of songs that the guitar hero and rock band demographics might be familiar with.
I got this game after purchasing a PS3, thinking that even if this game wasn't all that great, I could use the two microphones (which came with a USB adaptor) for Karaoke Revolution games.  I was wrong.  Because the microphones are not actual USB mics and have to plug into a USB adaptor, Karaoke Revolution games do not detect these "SingStar" mics.Secondly, SingStar does not give you the option to remove the lead vocals from the songs.  This defeats the whole purpose of Karaoke.  Even on Karaoke mode, the lead vocals are still there.Lastly, The game has a very small selection of songs, and there are a handful of tracks that are "medleys", which are basically a medley from choruses of the same songs that are already on this game.Conclusion.  This is NOT a Karaoke game, as it does not give you the option to strip the lead vocals, and the microphones included with the game are not compatible with any other games for the PS2 or PS3.  If I was given the option, I would give this game ZERO stars.

Robotech: Battlecry is a good game.  There.  I've said it.  A cel shaded shooter with a resurrected license sounded like a recipie for disaster in this day of the &quot;make it quick and they'll buy it anyway&quot; mentality.  Shockingly, Vicious Cycle has pulled off a pretty solid effort.  It isn't no Ace Combat 04, but it isn't half bad.Battlecry has lots of levels and decent graphics to boot.  The familiar Robotech soundtrack is here, unfortunately it is a remixed version which isn't as good.  Oddly, the soundtrack suddenly speeds up (bad glitch) sometimes.  There are voice overs from some of the original cast members reprising their roles from the Macross Saga of Robotech.  Sound effects are ok, nothing special.Where Battlecry succeeds is in the control.  Your veritech fighter controls differently in all the 3 transforming modes, and learning to deal with the 3 modes is a lot of fun.  ThePS2 controller is suited to this type of game, and seems better than the Gamecube's or even the XBox's control schemes.A word to the original Japanese Macross fans:  It is a fun game, and though it has the Robotech license, might at least be worth a rental if you're too mad at HG to buy it.

Jak II is suposed to be cool but it isnt. Its a babyish game that was supposed to be cool. I have no idea why its reated T. It should be E or lower. It is almost the exact same thing as Jak and Daxter. Dont buy it even if you liked Jak and Daxter.

With Jak and Daxter, developer Naughty Dog basically retreads over the successes of their past, stopping only to make a few necessary tweaks that had been sorely lacking in similar titles in the past. And that's not necessarily a bad thing, because the platforming genre had by this time been hammered down to a few absolutely key elements that are necessary for such a title to be successful. At a glance, the game presents nothing all that noteworthy; a gratingly bubbly cartoonish cast, a story pulled right out of a coloring book, bright and shiny graphics to match, the existence of an occasional power-up, and a large cluster of bottomless pits. Make no mistake, if you cringe at the thought of spending a few days in front of a game that looks and speaks like something you'd expect to see on a Saturday morning cartoon, this is absolutely not the game for you. If you share a house with more than just a pet or two, your roommate(s), spouse(s) or family member(s) will be making fun of you. If you're at a point, spiritually and emotionally, where you can deal with that... there's a somewhat enjoyable little game buried underneath it all.The storyline is easy to establish, short on dialogue and heavy on gameplay, and that's just about the extent of the good things I can say about it. The story is bare bones at best, establishing the good guys and the bad guys right off the bat, (the bad guys are the ones with tusks) introducing a conflict (the guys with tusks want to unleash chaos on the world) and a motivation, (Jak's buddy Daxter falls into a pit of mystery goo, transforming him into a furry critter) eventually unleashing you out onto the world to fight evil or some such nonsense. The characters themselves are just paper-thin and almost completely devoid of emotion or appeal.Jak, the main character, (naturally) is conspicuous in his silence throughout the tale, leaving the majority of the speaking parts to the green sage (an elderly wizard who grants you a miniature nugget of motivation at the outset of each level) and Daxter, (the aforementioned furry sidekick, equipped with enough cheesy one liners to make Rodney Dangerfield spin wildly in his grave) both of whom are way, way over the top in the "flamboyant personality" department. Once in a while, the sage's daughter will pop in to share a new bit of technology or something, and as you visit new towns you'll meet a new character or two, but for the most part it's Daxter and the sage bouncing off of one another and Jak standing around to make confused or frustrated faces.If you've played any of the post-SNES three dimensional platformers that preceded it, you've probably got a good handle on how Jak and Daxter feels. You've got an overhead camera dangling just behind you at all times, a couple very basic attacks, and the vital ability to jump. As you progress through the game, you'll discover different variations upon Jak's abilities as they're necessitated, such as the ability to somersault, to crouch, to double-jump and to long jump. What's cool is that these abilities aren't something you need to unlock... they're available right from the get-go, so there's a process of experimental discovery that makes you feel directly involved in Jak's progression as a character. On the other hand, the existence of these abilities and instructions on their use are never truly explained, so if you haven't discovered the long jump by the time Jak needs to clear a large canyon by his lonesome, you're in for a long, painful series of trials and errors.Despite the occasional difficulty in explaining its own controls, the actual gameplay of Jak is largely a lot of fun. Obstacles are challenging without being frustrating, most of the puzzles are just difficult enough to whir your gears without forcing you to seek out a walkthrough in a moment of fury, and the boss fights are wholly entertaining. It makes good use of the power-ups, staggering them early to get you used to their intentions and then introducing them at just the right times as they become more and more important later in the game. It does have a few small hiccups that will continually bother a refined gamer by failing to function as designed at critical moments. For example, Jak doesn't always latch onto the corner of a ledge, Prince of Persia-style, like he's supposed to. Nine times out of ten, he'll perform the brave feat without hesitation, but it seems like the most important jumps are usually where he has the most trouble, slamming into the edge of a platform and then awkwardly vibrating for a moment before falling to his death. Likewise, the extremely touchy nature of the double-jump system also provides for its share of headaches.Although I complained a bit earlier about the game's hesitancy to fully explain its control scheme, once you've experimented enough to actually discover all of the characters' possible actions, the full control scheme is really very basic and easy to grasp. The way some games map out their button setups, I wonder if they're expecting players to have an extra arm installed to make some certain actions possible (the Xbox release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas springs to mind.) Jak overcomes this potential flaw by keeping things extremely simple and never requiring the use of more than two or maybe three buttons at the same time, analog stick included. By limiting themselves to the R1 button, the four main control buttons (X,O,Triangle and Square) and the analogs, they ensure you never need to move a finger into an awkward position and allow you to really envelop yourself in the game.I think I was expecting a bit more out of the graphics, since this was an early title for the PS2 and that's usually when developers are frothing at the mouth over the new hardware and going out of their way to show off everything it can do. The visuals of Jak and Daxter just feel like a marginal improvement over the visuals of Naughty Dog's PSone titles, and certainly didn't age well in the almost five years since it was released. Part of that is due to the cartoony direction taken by the art, but you can't blame the lumpy renderings of the sage's face when speaking or the distractingly simplistic appearance of most of the game's enemies on artistic decision. Some things, such as the distant skylines in the forest and the radiating glow of eco matter in the wild, are very well executed, but on the large this is no showpiece for the PS2's visual capabilities. Bluntly, if you're looking for an exceptional early graphical display on the PS2, keep looking.Voice acting aside, I can't say much nicer things about the audio. I suppose it's of a higher quality than the tunes found on the old PSone, albeit not by much, but the compositions themselves are so aggravatingly bouncy, joyful and happy that if you aren't, in actuality, a Care Bear, you'll want to rip your hair out by the roots. While I'm not sure something like heavy metal or R&B; would suit the feel of the game much better, I was expecting something a little more contemporary and interesting, considering the marketing that announced the game's launch (remember the commercials with the title characters reclining, poolside, with a cluster of bikini-clad young ladies? Yeah, I don't think they were aiming those at the 7-10 year old market.) The voice acting is sound, for the most part, with a few performances standing out above the others. The dark sage's voice perfectly matches his demeanor and appearance, while the green sage really feels like an old man tired of the world that surrounds him, but determined to aid in its resuscitation, all the same. On the other side of the coin, bad voice acting isn't exactly missing, either, and the dialog is so bad that even the competent actors have trouble making their lines come to life.When stripped down to its very basics, Jak and Daxter is an entertaining play. While there isn't anything the actual gameplay does badly, nit-picky flaws aside, there's also nothing that it really excels at. It's a good next-gen translation of an already-enjoyable system of mechanics, controls and direction, basically reading the map drawn by its forefathers and following it to the gold buried at the end. If it weren't for the abysmal storytelling, the hot and cold voice acting and the sub par graphics and sound, this would probably be deserving of a score well above average, that map is so well-drawn. Unfortunately, I can't honestly say that those factors don't affect my opinion of the disc itself, and they drag my score down by quite a bit. If you can shut your brain off or go to make a sandwich during the speaking parts and accept the visuals for what they are, you'll really enjoy this one. For those of us looking for a complete package, prepare to be somewhat disappointed.

I tried all 3 driving games and Gran Turismo 5 has better eye candy, more unlocked modes, has both NASCAR and 5 cities (london, spain, italy, france, tokyo) and driving conditions, and 2 players split-screen.  Gorgeous eye candy like I'm watching the Travel Channel.NFS Hot Pursuit and Blur only had 2 unlocked modes.  They were also only 1 player.Test Drive 2 Unlimited has a great storyline.For car driving games that show car damage, I'd recommend GRID and MOTOR STORM PACIFIC RIFT.

They were also only 1 player.Test Drive 2 Unlimited has a terrific storyline.For car driving games that show car damage, I'd recommend GRID and MOTOR STORM PACIFIC RIFT.-------------5/22/2012 update: I got Xbox's Forza 4 and driving with the kinect is incredible and so much more natural than using $100 steering wheel with the GT5.  Plus, Forza shows crash damage whereas GT5 does not.  I'm going to tradein my GT5 because Xbox's Forza 4 is better than Sony GT5.
If you enjoy the likes of Project Gotham Racing, Dirt, Grid, or any other title in the the Need for Speed franchise, you will likely enjoy the sometimes overwhelming amount of audio/visual eye candy presented in NFS: Shift.  However, if searching for a "close-as-it-gets" simulation-style racer, such as Race Pro, Gran Turismo, and the Forza, I recommend avoiding.Graphically, the game is beautiful.  Audio is decent also - although not as accurate as Race Pro or Forza.  Electronic Arts certainly did revamp their physics engine in this title, giving it a slightly more controlled version of the one found in GRID.  Yet, body roll is dramatically over-done, creating vehicles that feel more like drift-racing air-ride suspension Cadillac sedans.  Initially, I was convinced this was a direct result of a tuning setup/car type, yet was disappointed to find even the high-end sports cars - those tuned with suspensions stiff as a board - flopped and skidded from one side of the track to the other at even the slowest "highway" speeds.On a positive side, though, it is certainly nice to see the Need for Speed line-up change things up a little by taking the racing off the street and on the track.  Especially with the number of famous tracks (Mazda Laguna Seca, Brands Hatch, Silverstone, etc.) recreated brilliantly in the game.Bottom line:  moderately, sometimes majorly unrealistic vehicle physics and typical Need for Speed flash mar the potential of a great Forza sim racer competition.  Simulation buffs should steer towards Race Pro, or wait for Forza 3.
This is a great driving/racing game on its own, and this racing game deserves merit on its own basis.  However, times have changed even during the release of Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit 2, and EA should realise this by now.  First, the tracks are limited to four, and you see the same tracks with the same traffic and the same environments.  True, you do reverse and mirror the tracks, but the tracks are the same nonetheless.  Second, I do appreciate that the cops work together and are quite aggressive, but the fact that they only pursue AGGRESSIVELY you for the most part I find kind of cheap.  Even when playing multi-player, for example, the first player (e.g., first slot) always gets hunted down by the choppers and spike strips while the second one is always for the most part ignored.  "Test Drive" also suffered from the same problem.  Next, the tracks should have allowed more freedom via Midnight Club 2.  Maybe in the future?  Furthermore, there should be weather variants.  Lastly, the selection of licensed cars is cool, but there is really no motivation to obtain more cars as you progress because some of the tracks the AI cars cheat, somehow avoiding cops while you are being tracked down and hunted. So ultimately, it's a hopeless quest to obtain more cars, even if you wanted to because the cops are ONLY after you.  The game does a motion that the cops are after other cars, but it's a ploy.  Overall, it's fun with other people around, but otherwise, stick with Midnight Club 2 for great excitement and actual variance with the tracks.

this game is exelent but for 1 or 4 moths is boring. and is too short.
A sim game is a game where you get to build everyhting from stratch, get family trees, relationships, BUT you cannot do anything like that in this game! ALL you do is just talk to people until you finally get to Darius's penthouse.. AND talking was SO boring, you couldn't even fall in love until you did the act romantic act when it finally turned yellow.There are only 3 apartaments, 9 districts.. AMAZING isnt it?! And working was boring since you had to just press the buttons that it had on the middle of the screen, who cares? And also, it isn't educational, entertaining AT all! The sim games always had something to keep you hooked AND what is this to keep you hooked? nothing.Do your money a favor and don't buy it!

Modeled after both San Francisco and Los Angeles streets, this game portrays a world that is perpetually caught between twilight and two in the morning, with the occasional rainstorm thrown in.I don't like it a great deal because it caters to an element of racers who abused the roads of Calfornia, and still do to this day (although the problem seems to have been put under control).The cars are so-so to ho-hum, and the game graphics seems to have been predominantly financed by sponsors of various 3rd party car-gear manufacturers.EA used to be a twenty minute walk from house when it was based off of 92, and it now a ten minute drive.  As such it's no surprise that most of the Bay View world looks like the San Francisco Bay area, with elements of LA, Tahoe, Sacramento, and San Diego thrown in too boot.It's on okay addition to the series, though I would have preferred another model other than Brooke Burke to play the "hottie" that owns your street rig.It's worth five bucks, but not much more.

This game pictured wasnt the game that we got and when we recived the game it was cracked from the center almost all the way to the outer edge!!
It's tough to explain why a certain videogame was fun for me, while it has been rightfully criticized by others for its shortcomings."Rise To Honor" is a short game, with decent graphics, basic level design, silly stealth missions, ridiculous action sequences, and a relatively simple story.  But like a typical action movie, it's one of those rentals that I can't bring myself to hate.  I enjoyed the barrage of bad guys to beat up.  I enjoyed the simplicity of those stupid stealth levels.  I enjoyed travelling from Hong Kong to San Francisco, combatting my way to the truth.  I enjoyed the mindless gunplay.  Most of all, I appreciated how the story --- while nothing special --- was treated with some decent drama.At its core, "Rise To Honor" is a chance to show off how you, the gamer, control Jet Li's body to kick all sorts of bad guy butt.  The motion-capture work is incredible, even years after its release.  You truly feel like Jet Li is the star of your own action picture, and it's the one element that will pull gamers through.  The story isn't worth going into, but let me just say that I enjoyed how Jet Li's undercover cop is thrust into a tale of betrayal, and tries to avenge who killed his honorable crime boss (strange, I know).  And what a coincidence...he finds his two childhood friends while fighting his way to through the end!"Rise To Honor" is a failure for some gamers because it tries to do a little bit of everything.  One level, you'll be using your martial arts to beat up some bad guys.  Suddenly, you're asked to unload bullets into countless foes.  Then, you're sneaking into a party from guards with flashlights.  It gets even crazier when you're outrunning a helicopter, dodging a sniper, and using a hospital stretcher to chase a villainess.  But you see, this variety works for me.  I know that many games have better fighting, better shooting, and better stealth.  But "Rise To Honor" somehow pulled it off for me, because it gave the basic tools I needed to entertain myself in one short dose after another."Rise To Honor" is like playing an action movie.  The levels are divided up like a DVD chapter menu!  Just skip to your favorite part once you've finished it.  There are even making-of featurettes detailing the hard work that Sony put in.  This game will not go down as a classic, nor does it deserve to be.  But it is not a trainwreck that deserves endless scrutiny.  "Rise To Honor" is one of those rentals (or cheap buys) that won't disappoint you.  It doesn't aim for greatness, so why should you expect it?
