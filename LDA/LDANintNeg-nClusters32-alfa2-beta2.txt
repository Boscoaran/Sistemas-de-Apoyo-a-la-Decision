El juego para multi jugador de las campanas es muy bueno, muy divertido. Pero los otros juegos de m&uacute;sica no son tan emocionantes, tanto que los ni&ntilde;os r&aacute;pidamente dejaron de jugarlo. Actualmente cuando lo colocamos solo jugamos las campanas. Mis dos hijos est&aacute;n en lecciones de guitarra y piano, esperaba entonces que este juego complementara sus lecciones para desarrollarles de alguna manera el sentido musical, pero el juego es muy aburridor.

Mario's first portable adventure, though fun while it lasts (which isn't long), is the weakest entry in the "Super Mario" franchise.  The tone of the game, while clearly modeled after the original "Super Mario Bros." for the NES, has a much different feel to it than [any other Mario time] Mario game.  That is because Shigeru Miyamoto did not produce the game; instead, his mentor, Gunpei Yokoi, produced and directed the title.Yokoi, who was killed in a car accident in 1997 in Japan, was Miyamoto's mentor.  It was because of Yokoi that Miyamoto's game "Donkey Kong" came before the leaders of Nintendo at the time.  Yokoi came up with the Game & Watch series, "Kid Icarus" and "Metroid" for the NES, and the Gameboy.  (A "Metroid" enemy even makes a cameo appearance in "Super Mario Land").The game features elements not seen before (or since) in the Mario series, including Egyptian themed bosses (although the Egypt theme is common in Mario, the bosses from SML are never heard of again, just like SMB2), space aliens, an apparent unending fascination with Easter Island and its Moi heads, and even two Shooting levels.  Although Miyamato revealed in an "Iwata Asks" interview that the original "Super Mario Bros." was going to have shooting levels, and the coin heavens are left over fragments of that idea (along with Mario having a gun), this idea was never implemented in the core series with the sole exception of "Super Mario Land".I grew up with Mario, like most other gamers. With only two exceptions, I have played every Mario title at launch or shortly thereafter, from the original 1985 "Super Mario Bros" all the way down to "New Super Mario Bros. 2" (yes I'm old). Obviously being American we didn't get "Lost Levels" until "Super Mario All-Stars", but I got the SNES version when it was released back in '93 and have played through "Lost Levels" so many times over the years I've more than made up for not getting it back in 1986.Anyway, the two I missed? "Super Mario Land" for the Gameboy (which I did play very briefly back when it first came out, but I never had it; we went with "Super Mario Land 2" instead when I did get a Gameboy) and "Super Mario Sunshine".  The very few times that I did play the game on the original Gameboy back in 1989 or the very early 1990s, I do remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done.Being the Mario fan that I am, I did play through "Super Mario Land" on emulator a couple of years back, beating  the game over two decades after it was first released. [Before I really played the game I remember getting as far as the first boss, which means I was a fourth of the way done].  Since then, I purchased the title on the 3DS Virtual Console (love those restore points!)So my thoughts on the game?  Well, of all the Mario games, this is easily the most insubstantial title in the entire franchise of proper "Super Mario" games (I am not including spin-offs and subseries).  "Super Mario Land" was a launch title for the Gameboy, and boy does it show.  The majority of the sprites are small, including Mario himself.  Being monochrome, it can be hard to see what is going on given how small the sprites are as well as how small the screen is. The game is SHORT - only twelve levels.  Each level has about a 400 second time limit, so to do a full run through of the game, even dragging your feet, will not net you much gameplay in terms of time.Due to Miyamoto's lack of involvement, the setting and overall enemy roster feels quite different than other Mario titles.  There are octupuses, jumping flowers that shoot fire (reminds of me of Panser from "Super Mario Bros. 2", Gaos (they resemble Egyptian sphinxes), robots (!!), Totais (running Easter Island Moai  heads), Pionpis (jumping men who shoot at Mari in the last world) and Yurarin Boos, who are fire-breathing seahorses.  The last two are the most interesting, as they are heavily reminesnt of "Metroid".  The Pionpis reminds me of Samus Aran's female sprite when the JUSTIN BAILEY code is entered, and the Yurarin Boos are identical to the seahorses (in terms of game play and species type, though the sprites differ somewhat) in "Metroid" as well.The game is set in Sarasaland, comprised of four kingdoms, Birabuto, Muda, Easton and Chai.  Suddenly an evil space alien named Tatanga appears, kidnaps Princess Daisy (who debuts in this game), and it is up to Mario to rescue the Princess (but it's not Princess Peach at least).Probably my biggest complaint about the game, besides the short length, is the looseness in the controls.  I don't know if this holds true for the original Gameboy (I suspect it does), but playing on the 3DS, I found Mario often times going slightly further than I wanted, [or not far enough].  I've never hard this problem with the other Mario games.  There is also some weird hit detection issues going on.  I was playing 4-2, jumped up on a pipe with a pirana plant and definitely hit the plant, and Mario did not lose his power up.  I've seen this happen multiple times.The loose play control further exacerbates another issue: no saving.  If you run out of lives (unless you're on 4-3, the very last world), you have to start all over which can be frustrating.  If you die on the last level you do get two continues.  Often times due to the loose play control I would slightly overshoot where I was jumping and Mario would plummet to his death.  Now, to be fair, to expect such a short game all the way back in 1989 to having saving is ridiculous, but none the less the criticism holds that there is some inherent frustration having to start all the way over.  Nintendo could have at least provided continues (a more realistic option for a game of this age).  .The game is clearly modelled on the original "Super Mario Bros.", although with some noticable differences.  First, the music itself is unlike anything else in the series, and is one of the strongest assests the game offers.  Just like the first game, you can't go back to the left; the screen only scrolls right.  Mario's sprite is also modelled on his sprite from the NES title.The power ups are pretty weak.  There are exactly three: the Super mushroom, the Super Ball, and an invincibility star.  The Super Mushroom will make Mario big.  The Super Ball (this game's idiotic version of the Fire Flower) allows Mario to shoot projectiles.  However, the key difference between the fireflower and the super ball is that when you shoot the Super Ball, the ball will bounce off the flower floor and go up until it hits another surface.  So on levels that are pretty open, you shoot the Super Ball, it hits the ground right in front of Mario, and then shoots straight up into the sky, never to be seen again, rendering this power up effectively useless unless the enemies are right up by you, creating a bigger margin for error.  If you are in a more enclosed space, the ball will bounce around against the various surfaces until it either hits an enemy or times out.  Unfortunately you can only shoot one at a time, so if you have one bouncing around and it's not connecting with an enemy, you have to either go on or wait and try shooting whatever your aiming for after the first ball disappears.Like the other Mario titles, "Super Mario Land" would prove to be a massive hit, selling over eighteen million copies in its initial run.  What's depressing to me is that "Super Mario Land" actually outsold the far superior "Super Mario Bros. 3".  Note: that does not count the rereleases and Virtual Console sales, only the intial NES release vs. the Gameboy release.For a game of its time, the title is pretty fun.  But of all the games in the core "Super Mario" series, this is easily the least substantial title, due to its brevity, the loose play controls, and the overall disconnection from the rest of the series.  The games sequel, "Super Mario Land 2: Six Golden Coins", is infinitely better, with bigger sprites, more engaging gameplay, and a much longer gametime.  The music though from SML is, admittedly, fantastic and is probably its strongest point.Mario's first portable adventure, though fun while it lasts (which isn't long), is the weakest entry in the "Super Mario" franchise.  The tone of the game, while clearly modeled after the original "Super Mario Bros." for the NES, has a much different feel to it than [any other Mario time] Mario game.  That is because Shigeru Miyamoto did not produce the game; instead, his mentor, Gunpei Yokoi, produced and directed the title.Yokoi, who was killed in a car accident in 1997 in Japan, was Miyamoto's mentor.

Super Mario Galaxy 2 is, unfortunately, unforgivably bland. Simply put- it does not live up to the hype. It does not make the original SMG pointless in comparison (which is the ridiculous suggestion I've been reading on message boards by posters who are apparently still wrapped up in the hype machine to see things how they *really* are). The game basically copies every single aspect that made the original so great without adding much of anything innovative. Many of the enemies and obstacles are exactly the same, but placed in different environments and situations as a way to assure that any comparisons be kept to a minimum. The only problem there is that I can see through the disguise and take the game for what it really is: a decent continuation -but ultimately a shameless copycat- of a fantastic and highly original platformer in Super Mario Galaxy. This means not only does SMG2 hardly stand apart but it barely even warrants a purchase. This may be the first time in the Mario series I can recall where the follow-up (sequel) is almost exactly the same. Oh wait, there is one other example- the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (NES game). It's almost exactly the same as the first one, but most people either haven't played or simply don't care about the Japanese version of that old, overbearingly challenging game.It should be mentioned right away that the boss fights are much worse this time around. The strategies with bosses such as Bouldergeist and Bowser from Super Mario Galaxy encouraged me to sort through a fairly elaborate set of patterns concerning several different attacks until I finally figured out what it is I'm supposed to do. I mean while playing Super Mario Galaxy, I was standing there in my living room eagerly and excitedly trying to figure out their weak points all the while totally amazed that Nintendo actually went the extra mile in making them so varied. These are two VERY creative bosses that I happen to believe smear everything that SMG2 has to offer, that's for sure. What made them so extraordinary is that I was completely dumbfounded at the complexity of their attacks. "This is coming from a Mario game???" I'd frequently say to myself (since I grew up in the early 90's with Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World when boss fights were made extremely simplistic by only having to dodge a few moves and stomping on their head 3 times- the polar opposite of THESE fights). Everytime I made a mistake with Bouldergeist or Bowser (which was plenty of times I'm embarrassed to admit) it was the result of me being careless, not the game being cheap. Bowser in particular completely blows me away. His pattern consists of dodging SEVERAL fireballs, dodging his spiked-ball form, spin attacking his exposed weak point while he's rolling around in a temporary boulder formation, and carefully jumping over his many (up to 5 sometimes) layers of rings. If you mess up once and take a hit, Bowser seems to backtrack to his previous pattern and you have to successfully dodge these moves all over again. A far cry from say, luring him overtop a few layers of bricks so he can fall through the floor, or running underneath King Koopa on a bridge and reaching the end. Let's be honest, Bowser was bland in the early days with only fireballs and hammers doing any kind of damage. Yeah, this SMG fight is what I call extremely elaborate in comparison.Which brings us to Bowser's SMG2 battle. Well at least Nintendo had the good intention of making the boss fights strategic and enjoyable, but... it feels watered down and "Been there, done that" now. Bowser in particular is basically the same fight with only one or two new flashy moves (including launching high in the air and soaring down like a meteorite pounding the planet which is admittedly cool and encourages the player to ground pound these floating golden balls that temporarily hang in the air and smack Bowser's body) and it's impossible for me to believe anyone in their right mind would suggest this is in any way shape or form superior to his original incarnation from Galaxy 1 where the true innovation of boss fights and level design was in full swing. There's a gigantic floating snake boss that seems intimidating at first, but since he floats around the planet with a simple to take down strategy (all you really have to do is spin attack the rings on his body up to 6 times after hearing a familiar "choo choo" train sound effect as he shoots through the ground) he's not much of a threat and certainly not an appealing example of creativity. The fire snake fight is pretty hard, admittedly. Same battle, but he's on fire this time. I suppose the boss in Flipsville Galaxy is sort of unique- you have to walk under the floor (or over, depending on the situation) so you're standing directly underneath of the boss and ground pound his stomach. The bosses in Freezy Flake and Boulder Bowl Galaxy are WAY too easy and unnecessary inclusions.The darn piranha plant boss that screams like a baby comes back for another helping (you know, the first boss you fight in SMG) and this time he has no tail- you just repeatedly and mindlessly spin attack the cracked egg around his backside until it breaks and he dies. Why Nintendo felt the need to dumb down an already pathetically easy boss is beyond me. Just bringing it back is an even bigger question mark. A couple other bosses (and levels) come back for another round as well (such as an even easier to defeat Bugaboom, and that one thwomp area from Beach Bowl Galaxy but sped up considerably faster this time) and these are all totally pointless returns since we've already completed them in the previous game. Lazy programming decisions. I must say however, that the Megahammer is a really cool boss fight. You have to frantically run around platforms using Yoshi's tongue to gather torpedoes, and then launch them back at the glass sections of the Megahammer itself while dodging torpedoes and rings. Running around makes the battle quite the exercise too. Unquestionably a high point in the game. Bowser Jr's Boom Bunker is pretty cool as well, even though it's clearly just a gigantic screen-sized version of the Undergrunt Gunner from the first games Toy Time Galaxy with the same fireball-homing attacks and glass protection above his head. It only stands apart because you need a cloud flower this time given his enormous size.The music is a LOT worse too. Make that inconsistent- for every awesome theme we have to persevere a bad one. In the first Galaxy you had dreamy and effectively atmospheric outer space music of the Space Junk Galaxy, subtle touches of jazz in the grassy lands of the Honeyhive Galaxy (that's been remixed with unnecessary flutes here, though granted the flutes DO give it a peppy 70's feel similar to the Brady Bunch), the detective-like mysterious theme of the Bubble Breeze levels, and cool early 80's-resembling synths (particularly sounding like the rock band Genesis) in a couple of the water stages (such as Buoy Base). Actually the Buoy Base music plays in a stage here that strongly resembles the design of the Buoy Base itself, but dumbed down considerably with switch-hitting slow motion effects and less rotating platforms making for an easier climb in comparison. I do really admire a particular subtle touch when the music sounds like it's being played through headphones. This occurs briefly whenever you hit a switch. Not a fan of the cliched Middle Eastern music found in Clockwork Ruins Galaxy either.The music in this game just does not live up to the same incredible standard. There's a distinct style of jazz being played in several of the stages such as Yoshi's Star, Boulder Bowl and Throwback Galaxy. For my personal tastes, jazz music is completely inappropriate and distracting for video game music, especially in a challenging adventure game when concentration is mandatory for completion. Not the proper setting at all. At least the beach music this time is somewhat listenable. However let's give credit where it's due- one of the water themes is REALLY awesome (from Cosmic Cove). Dare I even say the best water theme ever? Probably influenced by the theme from the first Donkey Kong Country's water stage, it's amazingly effective in both mood and melody. Oh and Bulb Berry's Mysterious Glow (or rather Sweet Mystery Galaxy) contains another excellent theme that captures the feeling of dreaminess. I really DESPISE the theme from Throwback Galaxy. Perhaps you'd have to either be a huge fan of Super Mario 64 or simply have strong childhood memories of the Nintendo 64 days in order to appreciate this theme, who knows. Then again I can name an equally crappy song from Yoshi's Island and no special memories in the WORLD can make *that* piece of music any more enjoyable. The other water theme from Slimy Spring Galaxy sounds like some partial Radiohead-influenced ambient piece that doesn't work for me. I admit I absolutely LOVE the Upside Dizzy Galaxy theme. The main melody is based around one or two techno notes with a colorful dash of other rich and rewarding arrangements in the background. A well-performed song, as is the familiar underground Super Mario Bros. theme turned really eerie and haunting in the Flip-Out Galaxy.Only a few levels are superior to the ones from the first Galaxy in the fun department. It should be said that the ghost galaxy in this game (called Haunty Halls) is better than the ghost sections of the previous Galaxy only because these ones actually feel like *levels* where you have to avoid disappearing/chasing boos along with the obstacle of having to jump across several tricky designed platforms that come out of the dreaded dark matter. You better polish your shoes if you want to quickly make it across these moving platforms! Lots of dangerous and exciting situations this time around that really plays on the ghost theme- unquestionably influenced by Super Mario World's ghost houses. It actually FEELS like I'm going through a haunted house in SMG2. This was sorely needed in the original SMG's ghostly stages. The one section where you're surrounded by dark matter and urgently need to run through moving platforms is atmospherically creepy and it's quite intense making your way through. The ghostly portions in SMG are mainly occupied with ghost races which are really cool, don't get me wrong, but not as entertaining as the actual ghost stages featured here. I could probably do without the obvious Super Mario World moving platform imitation, however. I think the planet with these type of platforms is called Boo Moon Galaxy. Riding on them wasn't particularly fun in Super Mario World (because I remember how many times I'd miss and fall into the lava, ugh) and it's not any better here. I guess seeing the same set-up upgraded to a 3D environment is sort of cool, though.Several levels are flat out boring. The honey (bee) levels are back and the one called Honeyhop Galaxy is shorter and somewhat sloppy and rushed in its design with less emphasis on exploration. Honeybloom Galaxy is worse since it's based around a really easy 2D level design with hardly any dangers whatsoever. A level for babies or newbies. At first my impression of this stage is that it works magnificently as a fast-paced chase to the finish involving swinging over vines and avoiding pockets of water while in the bee form. Now however, I realize it severely lacks challenge. I feel the same way about the 2D swimming portions from the Cosmic Cove stage. Beautiful, but easy easy easy. The lava levels have segments that are really intense and nerve racking such as the one with the mad dash upwards across several fast-moving platforms while trying to hold onto a cloud flower, and the exceptionally frightening stage where a neverending parade of those lava monsters (that first appeared in Super Mario World) march down the screen and munch at the platforms, requiring the player to be really careful moving across- can you say pink elephants! However these levels ultimately fail to live up to the consistency and plentiful variety that the original presented with the Melty Molten stages and feel more like rehashes, and my goodness, who in their right mind thought it was a good idea to overload this game with so many darn gigantic CHOMP HEADS and OCTOOMBAS? They were implemented just enough in the first Galaxy to get your fill, but here? It's overkill, seriously. Chomps are rolling all OVER the darn place and octoobmas are located in every single place where they can get in a cheap hit (now occasionally shooting TWO rocks at a time, ugh!) The entire galaxy devoted to the numerous chomps is a nightmare too, especially the one where you have to spring bounce (or backflip) over an endless amount of chomps rolling across the floor. The level that is puzzle-like with the gold rolling chomps unfortunately isn't backed up by being any fun on numerous playthroughs. It's more like "Oh that was clever" when you figure out you're supposed to roll the chomps across platforms a certain way while *standing* and pushing down on the blue buttons, but definitely annoying to repeat this level again. Oh and you'll sometimes see MINI chomps as well (or kid chomps as I like to call them).The water stages are worse in SMG2. I admire the way the Cosmic Cove Galaxy alternates between 3D and 2D camera angles and swimming movements, and creatively uses a freezing technique near the beginning that makes the water and the scenery very beautiful. The part near the end where you're swimming through water cubes is unbelievably cool and a rare example of amazing design creativity. Still, none of this is the least bit challenging. I could definitely do without yet another bunny grabbing mini game though. I've had my fill of those from the first game. This rabbit mission is way more dangerous than all the ones from the first game combined due to the many holes that serve as endless pits, and the fast-moving ice skating skills needed to catch up to the bunny. However the first SMG game has so many unique and better utilized racing levels in the water with penguins, cosmic Luigi, whales, and an enormous bony fish boss fight with torpedoes that it comes as no surprise that the water stages in the sequel simply can't compete.There's a snow level here. It's not as enticing as SMG's Freezeframe Galaxy and it doesn't really do anything noteworthy that stands apart from the snow levels in several other 3D games, but I do admire the beautiful snowy environments. It's really short and generic with giants snowballs and snowgoombas everywhere. I admire the brief blizzard segment for the way it makes you feel secluded and lost somewhere in Russia. The sand levels -at least as far as collecting green stars- are MUCH harder this time around with more emphasis on overflowing rivers of sand and several rows of fast-moving fireballs. It's extremely easy to lose a life by making a bad jumping (or sliding) decision. Literally sliding off the entire river and directly into the bottom of the screen is a strong possibility. The sand often flows backwards, making the trip across even longer. I like a certain platform ride near the end of one mission, however. It involves magikoopas and yes, chomp heads. Magikoopa uses his magic wand and the chomp head uses his rolling ability to destroy portions of the moving platform that Mario is riding on, making navigation to the gold star tricky and fun. Bowser's final castle is rather disappointing since it's relatively bland in comparison to the fast-moving, obstacle driven intensity found in the first Mario game. The navigation through this one is slower, and the obstacles are less creative and threatening. It's inconsistent too. The part with the drill/pockets of sand/dodging giant bullet bills is boring with no replay value, and the segment with Yoshi near the end is downright tedious since controlling Yoshi whenever he grabs a dash pepper makes for plenty of jerky, awkward movements and plenty of deaths as a result of a rapidly closing wall made of fire that you'll discover. We've already seen rotating fireball rods mixed in with tricky camera angles for dramatic effect in the first game so nothing new in that regard here.Oh and the most insulting level imaginable is definitely the Throwback Galaxy. I don't mind the updated and prettier graphics of the Super Mario 64 levels (even though Nintendo is repeating what's already been done which just SCREAMS a lack of creativity) but what I DO certainly mind is the stage where you have to fight 5 bosses in a row from the first Galaxy. It's not only pointless to make us repeat the same bosses and strategies of the previous game, but it's also flat out boring and irritating since these bosses are the weak, easy versions and not the daredevil or speedy comet versions so there's no real urgency to try your hardest or even feel satisfied after you've conquered them. What a terrible idea to repeat what's already been implemented previously and a COMPLETE waste of time. Still, this is at least better than the levels that focus on red and blue platforms that open and close whenever Mario spins. Absolutely boring and a chore to go through these particular stages (the chore being, when you're not sure you'll make it across a long gap so you instinctively spin Mario at the end of a long jump and yet, spinning in this stage could result in a quicker death than you originally planned).The Supermassive Galaxy is obviously trying to recapture some of the magic that World 4 of Super Mario Bros. 3 used by scattering the levels with overgrown, super-sized enemies, however it's underutilized and way too short here. We've already seen giant goombas in the first Super Mario Galaxy, and giant green koopas and piranha plants were first presented to us, again, back in SMB3. This idea is nothing new or innovative. Oh and another major disappointment- another terribly bland beach level that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. Sorry Nintendo, but beach levels haven't been interesting in Mario games since Yoshi's Island. It's been THAT long! At least this one has Yoshi and spiny-throwing lakitus. The lack of interest is because these particular type of beach stages play on the "beaches are relaxing" theme (or in the case of a video game, "beaches are less threatening") which means these portions of the game are really empty with only a few enemies and dangerous platforms in sight, and honestly there's barely a reason why these particular stages should even exist other than tossing in a bit of variety. I mean if I wanted to take a breather I'd just put the game down for a few minutes. Beaches don't fit Mario games in my opinion. Oh and whether you're going through the stage normally or with the drill, it doesn't change the fact that Flipsville Galaxy is downright *boring*. I truly despise this stage. Drilling and/or flipping upside down over and over again just to progress forward... VERY tedious. The drill may be a cool item, but this is proof that basing an entire stage around it was a disastrous idea. The purple coin mission in this stage was initially horrendous due to the limited movements of using the drill, but better now that I found a reliable formula.I don't really like the cloud levels either (Fluffy Bluff and Cloudy Court Galaxy respectively) for a couple reasons. Again, the design of these stages is sickening and unbearably cutesy in a Super Mario Sunshine kind of way (the resemblance is immediately noticeable) and the cloud flower is overused in both stages (I'll share my feelings with this item below). Both stages share the same unbearably overdone orchestration. The Puzzle Plank Galaxy is fun the first time around, but never again. Catchy hoedown theme song at least. The Space Storm Galaxy was great until all potential was lost the moment I had to guide one of those darn red spinning topmen around several open holes and do this while avoiding these VERY annoying, tiny ricocheting type enemies that insist on pushing Mario over the side and to his death. The topmen were more tolerable in the first SMG game. The Battle Belt Galaxy feels more like a practice or beginners course stage for those unfamiliar with the game mechanics and the way Mario travels (star blasts) from one miniature planet to another fighting enemies that are basically generic and overused by this point. Even worse- this stage appears in World 6 near the end of the game! The worst spot to put a level like this. This stage is unnecessary in my opinion and feels incomplete. The Flash Black Galaxy is a total ripoff of an old Donkey Kong Country level where the lights frequently flicker on and off. Same idea here, but at least in the case of the SMG2 level it's saved by unique floating movements by Yoshi. However I found out that sticking to the left the whole time guarantees an easy trip to the launch star- turn right when you reach the top ceiling. Oh well. Some of Bowser's stages are boring. I already mentioned Bowser's Galaxy Generator (the last one) but Bowser's Fiery Flotilla is dreadfully dull and short (as is Bowser Jr's Boom Bunker which isn't even a stage really).Much to the displeasure of thousands (if not millions) the rolling starball levels are back and more complex than ever! Oh and get this- while riding and maneuvering the ball you actually have to push chomp heads off platforms. No kidding. You can probably sit there and imagine how difficult this is, however nothing and I mean NOTHING is harder than the purple coin mission where you're rolling down a steep rainbow-colored hill at lightning speed and forced to collect (if memory serves) 100 out of 110 coins. This means you can only miss 10 coins while riding that horrendous starball and trust me, it's VERY difficult. You better believe you're in for a rude awakening with this stage, haha. I wish the bubbles and stingray race levels from the first Galaxy made a return. They were awesome, however in Galaxy 2 you get gliding levels with tedious and jerky movements. The backgrounds may be beautiful (especially the dark green trees and peaceful flowing rivers in Wild Glide Galaxy) but the frustratingly SUPER slow control movements of the actual gliding makes it hard for me to enjoy these stages. I REALLY wish you could pick up speed by simply holding down the A button. Instead, speed increase occurs by pointing the Wii remote down but... depending on the mission, sometimes this isn't reliable enough to gain enough speed. If you remember stingray racing was fairly simple since the object was to just make it to the goal in under 3 minutes. I wonder if the generous 3-minute expectation is because Nintendo thought people would struggle to just keep the stingray on the slippery and narrow water track? We'll never know the reason for such a generosity. Anyway, back to the rolling starball level with the chomp head. Get this- you actually have to re-do this stage if you want the extra star, and this time you're TIMED! As if maneuvering the starball wherever you want it to go isn't difficult enough. It's a nightmare, trust me! Still, the requirement in memorizing the ramps in Rolling Coaster Galaxy is necessary in order to collect 100 purple coins which easily makes it the second hardest level in the game.Yoshi is a decent addition but he's not as frequently available as you'd probably expect given all the hype he's received from the numerous online reviews you've probably read. He's in a few levels though, and while he's there he's certainly fun. An extremely easy and effective way to get rid of enemies maybe, but fun. Mindlessly and constantly tapping the B button makes using Yoshi WAY too easy. You'll find out what I mean when you play the game. Otherwise I can take or leave him. The powerups are somewhat cool, such as the boulder that can charge into (and break) heavy objects. I like this one the most because crashing into objects feels impactful and adrenaline-rushing. There's a boulder level where you have to jump over a series of platforms and it's probably going to result in over 100 deaths until you complete it. This is all because of one tricky part at the very end where you have to roll into a bouncy thing that makes you go in a completely different direction, and then forward up the path to the star. You have to accomplish this without rolling off the side. It's incredibly hard believe me. Some people complain about the stiff controls, but to me it's understandable that controlling a boulder would be difficult. The drill is alright I guess. You can dig through the soil and land on the other side of the planet. This is used in a fairly clever way on a few occasions- you can take out enemies and bosses by popping out of the soil underneath their bodies for a nifty attack. However it's a severely limited powerup used mainly for just these two purposes. The honey bee makes a return as well, and it's exactly the same. With all this said, I REALLY don't understand what makes the cloud flower so appealing to the masses. It's really not that fun skipping through several portions of a level by creating/floating on clouds; just convenient. It's used WAY too many times throughout the game as well. Yes I realize the main purpose of the cloud flower is to be able to reach the really high or far out areas needed to collect certain important items, but come on, it's definitely not very exciting to actually *use* and fans are clearly overrating it. Perhaps the ice flower not being included this time around is a minor disappointment because it was pretty fun bouncing off walls and waterfalls with it, but at least the classic fire flower has remained. I enjoy the return of the hammer brothers even if they only appear in a few spots. They're much easier to handle in a 3D environment since the main challenge you faced in the older games was making sure you were able to successfully jump over (or run under) them without eating a hammer for your troubles. Now you can simply counter their moves by walking to their side (thank you 3D world!) and spin attacking them into pieces, easily avoiding the tossed hammers.Like I mention above, those dreaded purple coin missions are back and you may have already guessed- some of them are really a chore and time-consuming to play. One mission (Flip-Swap Galaxy) has Mario flipping through platforms while trying to avoid electric beams and rolling chomp heads which is a REALLY high challenge that requires accuracy of the highest extent. You can't make a single mistake either. In another level (Clockwork Ruins Galaxy) Mario collects coins while riding a few clockwise-rotating wooden or stone structure, and what makes it annoying is the way the rotation plays tricks with your mind- you WILL mess up, slide off and fall to your death. Guaranteed. Oh and what's now considered one of the hardest levels of all-time from the first Galaxy (Luigi's Purple Coins) returns, however now it's been dumbed down- the golden platforms no longer flip over. It still has the "step onto once and they disappear for good" green platforms, however. More or less the same idea returns, but now it's tame in comparison. The purple coins are easily within reach now. They threw in Mario clones (enemies that follow Mario's every movement- don't touch them) but they hardly ever interfere with your focus to collect the coins. I guess Nintendo received some hate mail from fans voicing their displeasure with the trickiness of Luigi's Purple Coins so they toned it down for the sequel, haha. The Yoshi mad dash purple coin mission in Starshine Beach Galaxy is fun but it's over before you can even blink your eyes, and the one purple coin mission where you're underground and encouraged to move quickly in order to avoid the Mario clones and grab the bunches of coins grouped together sitting on the small steps is another *extremely* short one. We're talking less than 30 seconds here for *both* missions. Not sure why the latter even exists- it's practically the definition of bland.Let's not kid ourselves however- the hardest stage by FAR (called Grandmaster Galaxy) is 100% guaranteed to have gamers pulling the precious hair out of their head. You have to go through six EXTREMELY difficult portions of the stage without taking a SINGLE hit. Let's break down how challenging this really is. First you have to carefully twirl your way around several floating rocks, paragoombas and torpedoes with Yoshi's tongue while being in the air the whole time, then you must step on several extra large blue platforms and make them turn yellow in order to open the launch star without eating two homing electric beams for your troubles, then you must make several cloud flowers and float over a series of electric beams that occupy the top and bottom of the screen with a few tricky spots in between, then you must properly figure your way through a series of red/blue flipping platforms while avoiding homing fireballs, laser rings and more electric beams (INCREDIBLY hard)... then you find yourself surrounded by even MORE trickily placed electric beams and paragoombas using the pull stars, and the hardest part of all comes last- dealing with quite a few insistently vicious hammer and boomerang brothers. Luck is pretty much the only way you'll make your way through a neverending swarm of spinning boomerangs and hammers in the final segment. In fact these obstacles are so difficult I just pretend the daredevil portion of this stage doesn't exist and settle with 241 stars. If you know what's good for your sanity, you'll take my advice and avoid this stage like the plague. It makes the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2/Lost Levels a cakewalk in comparison. The good news is that you're given the option to play through this stage the normal way (without the "one hit you're dead" way) which is STILL really hard regardless.The good news is that the very best level in the game hands down smears ALL the levels from the first Super Mario Galaxy- Tall Trunk's Purple Coin mission. This is easily the most exciting and coolest level ever for a Mario game. It's a fast-paced race... on feet! Is it sort of challenging properly landing your jumps, avoiding crawling wigglers and collecting enough coins? Absolutely. Is it fun? Absolutely! I'm also rather fond of a few mini games. The 5,000-point boulder/bowling mini game is a highlight, and especially the ones where you have to jump on enemies heads and produce enough points to reach 10,000. These ones in particular are *awesome* and a very useful way of temporarily bringing back the point system. I never cared for gaining enough points in the older Mario games since the only reward was achieving a really high score and bragging rights for beating your friends record highs, but now -with this challenge- there's a clear and exciting purpose in getting enough points. There's a 10,000 point mini game in the water where you can ride a koopa shell and destroy ghosts and weeds that's equally as much fun. The ice skating point games involving a monkey are pretty cool (but the second one that requires 600 points is WAY too hard). I also really love the missions where you only have less than a minute to take out a pack of octoombas in Shiverburn and Flash Black Galaxy. On the negative, I really miss the cosmic Luigi races from the first SMG game. They sort of remind me of Super Mario Kart but on feet. Also, the robot mini games this time around are honestly rather simple- you have to destroy a bunch of crates using a fire flower in under 30 seconds. A shallow game compared to the demanding bomb-tossing accuracy and short time limit that the robot requires out of the player in the first Super Mario Galaxy.
My anticipation for Super Smash Bros. Brawl was not as high as many Nintendo fans, but I still wanted the game. It's likely that if you are reading this review and you haven't already purchased the game, then you're the same type of gamer as me. Occasional Wii player who enjoys a good game. First thing I'll tell you is that if you consider yourself a "casual gamer," this game probably won't be your favorite, but you might still be able to get some enjoyment out of it. It doesn't use any of the friendly Wii controls that you are accustomed to having, and you won't stand much of a chance in the online modes without some serious practicing. Also, there is no tutorial to tell you how to play (although the instruction booklet does a good job of this). This review is written for the "casual gamer," since I assume most hardcore Nintendo fans have already purchased, and are enjoying the game. Finally, before I get into the review I'll give a quick description of the game for those that are new to the series... basically it's a "side-scrolling" fighting game, where you play as various Nintendo characters from both yesteryear and the present. Each character has his or her own set of special moves that can be used against the other players with a few button pushes. There are lots of modes, but in general the person that does the most killing and the least dying wins.Now onto the review... I've broken the review down into separate sections to make it more easy for you to follow, or to just get information about a particular topic.Graphics: 6/10Well, if you mention graphics, the first thing hardcore Nintendo fan will tell you is "GRAPHICS DON'T MATTER." My opinion of this is slightly different, while graphics don't make a game, they sure can help improve the experience. Now onto the graphics in this game.... most game companies have realized this by now, but apparently Nintendo didn't get the memo: cutscenes are better if they have similar graphical style to the game.In Super Smash Bros. the majority of the game looks exactly the same as its predecessor Super Smash Bros. Mele. Some will tell you this is fine, but I just don't understand how 7 years later they best they can pull off is "slightly better" than the previous game, even if the Wii isn't much more powerful. My second complaint here is the cutscene thing. Cutscenes were all pre-rendered and stored as movies. Sure they look amazing, but it sure takes away from the experience when you are playing a crappy game, you go through a door, wait for a load, watch a movie that looks nothing like what you can play, sit through another load, and then continue playing. It took me about 4 hours of play to realize that what was happening in the game was actually a continuation of what's showed in the cutscenes, that's how different things look between the two. Now for a casual gamer these details probably won't matter because you just want to play. And if you are the casual gamer, you will probably enjoy the graphics and cutscenes. But for me, and most people who are used to an immersive experience in the game, the graphics here just don't cut it.Sound: 10/10Chances are that everybody has played a previous Nintendo game. And chances are that the music from that game will have worked its way into this game somehow. The sound in this game is really amazing. There are hundreds of tracks from which to choose, and you can customize which tracks are played on which stages at which ratios. Also, there are many new recorded sounds for each character, and the new music that was made for the game is also amazing. All in all, the sound in the game won't disappoint anybody, casual or hardcore you will want to play this game on the loudest volume setting you can.Gameplay/Controls: 9/10If you've played a Smash Bros. game before, you probably don't need to read this section because nothing has changed too much gameplay-wise. It's the same "button-smashing" (or not button smashing if you know what you are doing) play as before, but everything is more balanced, and each character, despite their strengths or weaknesses has a fairly equal chance of winning. With 35 characters, I really gotta praise Nintendo for getting this balanced so fairly (although you will learn that there are still a few characters that realllly suck!!). They've also added more items (which you can pick up to add a crazy effect to the game, such as throwing a Pokeball at an enemy, and having it attack them). The gameplay is fair enough that a person who has never played before stands a fairly equal chance of winning a match as those who've played hundreds of games. Another amazing thing Nintendo did was giving you 4 ways to play. You can play with the Wii Remote turned sideways, with the Wii Remote "right side up" and the nunchuck, with the Wii Classic Controller, and with the Nintendo Gamecube controller. The system is brilliant, and allows you to change what every single button does for your particular setup. My only complaint in this section is that there are no motion controls whatsoever through the entire game, and it makes navigating menu's more of a pain than what you are used to on your Wii.Multiplayer: 5/10Offline: 5/5I'll start with the positive here. Offline multiplayer is amazing. They've got "tournament" support for up to 32 players, with each player being able to VERY easily pick which controller they use, and play against a randomly selected group of people from the tournament, moving up the bracket to the championship. They've also got a simple rotation mode where up to 32 people rotate through playing random maps where the loser(s) or winner(s) swap out with people who are waiting (Don't worry, if you've only got 30 friends you can have 2 AI players fill the extra spots for you). It eliminates the "hey it's my turn you have played more" aspect of your party because it keeps track of everybody's playing time and keeps things fair. Of course you can play just yourself against computer players, with varying level of skill. Once again, the players have excellent AI, and they "know" how to play to the strengths of their character without ever feeling unfair. All in all, this is by far the most solid Smash Bros. yet in terms of offline multiplayer.Online Multiplayer: 0/5Now it's time to talk about the Nintendo WiFi connection. To put it simply, it's just a mess. Either Nintendo hasn't played online on the Xbox 360 or the Playstation 3, or they simply don't care. There is still no universal friends list, voice chat, text chat, or any online features you are accustomed to from your other consoles. Whats even worse is Nintendo's excuse... they claim people don't want these features, and that they aren't safe. The other two consoles have made it pretty obvious that people DO want these features, and they've also added parental controls to make it completely customizable to parents that their children can and can't do. To me, Nintendo doesn't add these things out of sheer laziness. But let's talk about what is in the game. First of all, there's the "play with anybody option." If you choose this, you should (although many gamers have yet to get this feature to work) get matched with 3 other people (whose names you can't see), and play brawl with them until everybody quits. The other option is "with friends." With this feature, you can call friends, ask for their 12 digit friend code, enter it, have them to the same, and then play with them.Additionally, you are more limited with modes and maps than with single player, and the netcode (the portion of the game code that connects you to the internet and other players) is so poorly written that Nintendo had to put this right in the instruction booklet: "It is normal for the game to periodically freeze while playing online." Brawl is a more basic game than, say, Halo 3 or Call of Duty 4, both of which are consistently lag free, but Brawl is just plagued with lag. So much so that with most of your friends the game will be unplayable online. I wasn't expecting much from this game online, but it delivered even less than I expected. It's probably the worst Nintendo WiFi connection enabled game to date. Also missing is any sort of leaderboard feature, or a way to compare your scores to other gamers across the world (A feature which Microsoft and Sony REQUIRE every game to have on their systems). Now I know many Nintendo fans don't care about online, which is why I broke this section into two subsections, but for me this is really a huge turn off because I had planned to get a decent amount of play-time out of the online play.Single Player/Campaign: 7/10In addition to the wealth of multiplayer content we've talked about, the game also has a decent chunk of single player content. My favorite part is the "event matches," where you try to do other things such as race through a level or break all the pieces of a level in the fastest time possible. This really gives a nice break from the standard fighting component of the game. Also, there's an Adventure mode that takes about 8-10 hours to complete. As discussed in the graphics section, I wasn't a huge fan of the adventure mode just because the graphics are so much different between the cinematics and game. That being said, the actually playing of the single player is fairly fun, albeit VERY repetitive. Additionally, the boss battle at the end isn't even fun because the character is overpowered, cheap, and can just teleport away whenever you start hitting him. This doesn't detract from the game in any way, but it sure does make for an annoying way to end an otherwise fun adventure mode.  Nintendo does give plenty of reason to play though, as you will unlock lots of characters and stages to play on the more you play single player modes. Also added to the game was an "achievement" system, which allows you to look at things of importance you've done, and more things you need to do to unlock stuff. This is a very cool feature, but would have been cooler with an online component such as is done on Xbox Live, and what is soon to be done with Home on Playstation Network, so that friends can see what you've done and compare it to what they've done, which would have added HUGE amounts of replayability for Nintendo fans as they work their hardest to break those records.Overall: 3/5 Stars (An average of the above scores)Note that if you average all the above scores it would convert to 7.4/10.  Amazon doesn't allow parts of a star, and I didn't think the game deserved 4 stars so I rounded the 7.4 down to 3/5.  I'll leave you with a quick summary of the pro's and con's of the game:Pros:- Amazing offline multiplayer- Best Smash Bros. game yet in terms of gameplay- Great new items and characters- Single player will take some time to beat and is fun for the most partCons:- Possibly the most shallow and buggy online game ever (on ANY system)- The graphics in single player actually take away the cool experience of the game- Unfair boss battle at the end (It's NOT just hard- its unfair)?'s:- Why can Nintendo still not figure out online play?- Nintendo did an excellent job balancing characters, but why still leave a few that are extremely overpowered?- Why did Nintendo think it would be cool to put the best possible cinematics in the game, when games like Halo 3 (360), and Metal Gear Solid (PS3) have been getting massive praise for doing just the opposite?If you've played Smash Bros. games before and liked them, I recommend a purchase of this game. If you're more of a casual gamer, and enjoy some of the more basic games the Wii offers, you might want to do a little more research or consider a rent before you throw down $50 on this game.
Every once in a while I experience a piece of entertainment that is *so* overrated it's hard to believe I'm even living on the same planet as those that actually believe this is supposed to be the best. The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is that very piece of overrated entertainment. Talk about a video game that not only doesn't live up to the hype (not even close) but it doesn't do a darn thing to impress me even *if* I were to ignore all the exaggerated hype. This is a serious letdown of a video game. But again, please understand I'm not from the same planet as those that enjoy this game. I care about gameplay and replay value more than anything else. Apparently most Zelda fans believe puzzle-based dungeons and soulless overworlds are what defines the Zelda series.One thing that positively stinks is that the land of Hyrule, despite being presented as beautiful (and realistic- don't tell me Nintendo wasn't riding the 3D high in 1998 and going for realism here) it's basically a gigantic piece of nothingness. Simply a means of getting from one area to another. A large, colorless empty field that Link either runs or rides his horse across. Nothing magical, medieval or interesting about *any* of this. It feels too much like taking a typical walk across the field beside my house. Going into this game after a Link to the Past, you'll be scratching your head wondering what happened to the huge variety of overworld enemies, pretty and colorful environments and enticing obstacles. Remember all those trees, rocks, grass and water sections from Link to the Past? Remember how rich and vibrant they looked? Ha, nothing nearly as diverse is featured in this bland and inferior overworld. Oh sure the monsters come out at night (in predictable spots) but that's it. As far as I can see, only one monster actually comes out (named Stalchild). Terribly lacking. The trees are spaced apart in a way that feels lacking too.The dungeons is where this game severely misses the mark to such an extent that it's almost unfathomable to believe Nintendo thought releasing the game the way it is was enough to be sufficient. Again, where ARE all the enemies? Why am I roaming through temple rooms that are way too big for their own good? Are high ceilings and deep pits supposed to justify the lack of enemies because the tradeoff is that it feels like I'm really inside a castle now? Give me a break guys. The rooms are so big they basically have no life whatever. Instead of being loaded with enemies around every corner, these castles are alarmingly empty, lifeless and unacceptable. But... that's apparently okay, because Ocarina of Time is the first 3D Zelda game so its legendary influence and innovation makes it leaps and bounds above the sequels, right? Not in my world baby. The games following Ocarina of Time perfected the Zelda formula way more effectively. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword leaves this dated mess in the dust.While normally I don't care about graphics in a video game, you gotta admit that bright vibrant colors really make the epic heroic adventurous theme of the Zelda series more engrossing. This is just... gross. Only the realistic-looking (flawed) overworld is a sight to behold (which of course now looks significantly better in Twilight Princess). Clearly the effort involved in designing the dungeons isn't much to admire. I don't really mind the occasional choppiness concerning the edges of buildings, trees or other objects that are all part of the Nintendo 64's datedness. Sometimes these unintentional features can be quite charming or, at the very least, forgiving. What I DO mind however is when these features are all over the place to the point of being a distraction, or having a game entirely too long so we're forced to persevere these issues time and time again. In other words I'd be willing to forgive this particular shortcoming if the game made up for the choppy/uninspiring graphics in other areas. Sadly, it doesn't. This isn't even much of an issue compared to the other complaints I have (which I'll mention below- keep reading). These graphics -especially the ones in the dungeons- resemble the ones found in the ruins of Mega Men Legends and the walls of the Quake series. The graphics in Link to the Past are unique and cannot be compared to any other game.Let's discuss the dungeons, shall we? Despite being ridiculously and needlessly large with boring surroundings, most of them have such a small and uninteresting variety of enemies that it's almost a chore going through one generic room after another. Ocarina of Time shows the makings of early 3D development at its most obvious- the platforms are predictable square structures that requires the player to spend most of his or her time lining up Link in order to make proper jumps by turning the camera until Link is positioned enough to reach the platform directly ahead. When you combine the constant requirement of having to change camera angles with having to position Link correctly all for the purpose of being able to see what you're doing and where you're going, it's enough to make you think you're playing with string puppets. Again, early 3D design flaws and datedness.The storytelling is really basic and predictable. It's never elaborate like in Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. It's mainly about rescuing or saving these mountainous cave creatures called Goron's for the first half, and going back and forth from the past to the present in the second half. This is a really uninteresting way of time travelling that feels almost nonexistent due to being so poorly and unsatisfyingly implemented. It doesn't even feel or look like you're going 7 years into the future as Link's appearance is supposed to be that of an older person but he doesn't appear to be much different from his younger self. Oh sure he's slightly bigger as an adult and slightly smaller as a kid but it's very subtle. The music is the one area where the game succeeds quite amazingly however. All the theme songs are not only appropriate for the environments, but melodic and memorable. Several dungeon themes are well-made and believably chilling and haunting. The right ingredients were definitely put into the music-making aspect of the game. The Hyrule overworld theme is enjoyable too and won't get on your nerves despite all the time you will undoubtedly spend there.The dungeons are either incredibly simplistic with strategies that involve the overbearingly dull and overused crate-pushing to open up portals or switches, or hopelessly generic "I'm stuck in a maze and I can't get out" frustration that is an inconvenient trademark of early 3D game design. But... these aren't any ordinary mazes. These are mazes where your surroundings look identical around every turn, hence the flawed early 3D game design. A cheap way of making a maze seem more difficult than it has to be, or in other words, needlessly difficult chores instead of exciting castle exploration which is what made the 2D Zelda's so memorable. Sometimes you have to light torches with arrows or by other means, and quite often you have to collect 5 silver rupees to activate a switch/open a door. Collecting these silver rupees is WAY too similar to Super Mario 64 with the red coins. The Lost Woods is a tunnel-infested maze with no personality whatsoever. The Lost Woods -if you plan on getting everything the game has to offer- will most definitely be the source of endless frustration.The enemies, or rather, what little enemies you will stumble upon on your "adventure" through the temples, is probably the most aggravating part of the entire game. These dungeons are sorely in need of something to spice them up and make them pleasurable. You will often go 3 or 4 rooms at a time without seeing a single enemy. Why even have a sword? In the 2D games the idea was simple- just load or overload the rooms with a variety of enemies and, guess what? *Now* the dungeons are exciting. A genius idea really. Here? In Ocarina of Time? It's all about atmosphere. It's all about featuring as little opposing danger as possible so you can absorb what was once Nintendo's most recent creation back in 1998. But... Nintendo forgot to take into account that technology will inevitably advance and a game relying on atmosphere above everything else will eventually suffer and become inferior one day. What was once a brand new puppy in 1998 is now a tired old dog thanks to the surroundings being boring and incredibly basic in their design. Video game technology is destined to advance making a game like this completely forgettable. That's exactly what has happened with Ocarina of Time- it hasn't stood the test of time.Do you really think those poorly animated mechanical blue tektite spiders in the water dungon are worthy of a Zelda game? Seriously? Their animations are so stiff due to the Nintendo 64's limitations as a console that it's unbearable to deal with them and laughable at the way they lunge towards Link. But even then, *most* dungeon enemies fall way short of acceptable. Big Skulltula is a laughably bland attempt at being dangerous- it's more like a nuisance when one of these comes down out of nowhere while you're running around. The spikes that roll around are incredibly basic and uninteresting. Somehow *all* the enemies manage to never once be memorable. Ever! Ocarina of Time has dated horrendously, seriously. Wolfos are unintetionally funny with their choppy movements and the dated howling sounds they make, Red Bubble is basically the same thing as Big Skulltula but on fire, and Gibdos are boring. The ReDead's let out a hilarious scream that freezes Link in place which is inconvenient when you're trying to get up the ladder right in front of you and even more inconvenient when you're stuck in a room with two of them. Mummies are poorly designed since all you have to do is hookshot them, run behind them, and slice them with your sword. To be fair, some enemies are cool such as Deku Baba where it's best to snap its vine with the sword for an instant kill- creatively well done there. The Deku Scrub where you can block or sword swipe its shooting seeds with the shield and ricochet the seeds back at them is neat. And the Lizalfos and Dinalfos basically serve as mini bosses due to being somewhat harder and more sophisticated than the other ordinary enemies.The game overall has a shortage of rupees. They're really not that important which is odd. This is the first Zelda game I've ever played where rupees feel more like an afterthought. Not something to take real seriously. If you don't feel like collecting them, then don't- no harm done. The bosses are alright except for the irritating one in the water dungeon. You have to repeatedly hookshot him while standing next to the platform. It takes FOREVER (and no, this boss is *nowhere* as fun as the water dungeon in Link to the Past in case you're wondering). The hookshot is used MORE than the sword throughout the game because it serves as an effective weapon quite often. The hookshot is a highly recommended weapon to use in a variety of situations, but especially important when collecting these things called gold skulltulas. After you collect 10 gold skulltula tokens, you get a beneficial reward. You can only collect them after defeating the gold skulltula enemy (usually found on walls). I admit I love the witches you face in the Spirit Temple. While the temple itself is really short and boring, it's probably worth going through it so you can face the two witches that make for a rather entertaining boss fight. You have to use your shield to reflect shots at the *other* witch, and it's really fun and creative. The hookshot's basically a required item to properly deal with hard-shelled or spiked enemies in the dungeons and it's annoying that it's used WAY more frequently than the sword throughout the game. Due to how much precision is required to use the hookshot, using this item becomes a very tedious chore after a while (especially if you keep missing your target) and it slows down the pace of the game by a lot.If you haven't noticed yet, the water dungeon in Ocarina of Time is just abominable. I bring it up often to remind people how terrible a dungeon can be in every possible way. Also, the worst influence ever occurs here- the importance of playing the ocarina musical instrument for a variety of reasons (mostly for warping from one place to another). Nintendo really overdid this aspect of the game by implementing the ocarina WAY too many darn times. It's overdone. Just hurry up and play the darn song and move on for goodness sake. Don't make it so you have to play the ocarina up to 50 times, if not more. I never really counted how many times I used it. It was a lot. It severely drags the gameplay, atmosphere and excitement down and immediately drags the game to a screeching halt having to frequently stop and play these songs on the ocarina. Watching Link stand around and play the instrument is the fruitiest thing I've ever seen. No wonder people think Nintendo makes nothing but kids games these days. This game is partly responsible for that belief due to its influence.Ganon's castle is supposed to be exhilarating and suspenseful. It's supposed to be filled with dangerous traps, tricky puzzles and enemies all over the place. But... the one in Ocarina of Time falls way short of being presentable by normal Legend of Zelda standards. Instead the castle is dominated with mini quests where you have to go through 6 trials to dispel the main barrier. The problem is that each trial contains really simple and short rooms where you only spend a couple minutes in each one performing the same tasks that you already had to do in the previous dungeons such as collecting 5 silver rupees. This is the complete opposite of being overwhelmingly threatening. Another bonus point for Link to the Past. Oh and the Ganon fight? His strategy is stolen from Agahnim's battle from Link to the Past but takes SEVERAL more minutes to bring down. Remember how you fought Agahnim? Yup, same exact strategy but in a 3D world. Sigh. The second part of the Ganon fight (after a looooong and tedious time-based departure from the top of a castle) is to shoot arrows at Ganon and hit his glowing behind several times. It's really easy, all of it. However fighting him in one of the early dungeons (Forest Temple) is actually one of the most memorable in the entire Zelda series. This is because Ganon rides a horse in and out of these picture frames hanging on the wall making for a VERY unique graphics effect and perhaps an original concept. Reminds me of a Harry Potter movie.A few other complaints. Fishing is sort of fun but nothing really noteworthy. It's better than most fishing games I've played in other games I admit. Expect to be sitting and fishing a while in order to get the heart piece however. Most heart pieces are pretty challenging to acquire and take some serious effort to get most of them. That's a rare compliment I can give. Some of the other mini games such as riding a horse and shooting targets is pretty fun. I don't really like that part in the desert where you have to follow a ghost through a dust storm. If you fall behind even a *little* bit you'll lose. Performing this same ghost-chasing task earlier in the game in order to obtain the hookshot is more exciting since you're dodging fireballs. The other task earlier on in the game in the Ice Cavern that involves throwing blue fire over red fire is really overlong and entirely puzzle-based. Having to do this once or twice would have been suitable- not 15-20 times. This particular place is a victim of platforms that are basic and uninteresting.Basically, when compared to the 2D games, Ocarina of Time only feels like half a game due to the dramatic change of turning the Zelda series into 3D but only giving us a small portion of what's available in Link to the Past. As a result the game feels incomplete on too many occasions. It's because the Nintendo 64 is a limited console that's really only able to handle so much. Ocarina of Time comes up way short. Even the first couple hours are disappointing since it takes forever to actually get going. Avoiding being detected by guards isn't fun after the first time. Oh and speaking of avoiding detection- this game actually has a Metal Gear Solid stealth-style mission later on where you have to free these imprisoned carpenter people. The stealth is so underutilized and simplistic that this is the second biggest chore in the game next to the water dungeon. Equally annoying is upon freeing the 4 carpenters, these red sword-swinging enemies appear on screen. The SAME EXACT ENEMY 4 times in a row with *no* differences between any of them. At first these battles seem hard until you realize all you really have to do is lunge your sword directly at them about 5 times, and they fall over and die.Reading text and having boring discussions with Zelda, trees and other semi-interesting characters doesn't get the job done either. Ganon even seems significantly less threatening than usual (that one conversation with Zelda and Link with Ganon patrolling the hallways nearby in Hyrule Castle comes to mind here). I will admit that some of the flame-covered cutscenes involving Ganon riding his horse is very intimidating. The cutscene outside the bridge of Hyrule Castle comes to mind here. Otherwise, Ganon's presented uninterestingly. You're *supposed* to get a feeling of hopelessness that Ganon is going to take over the world and wipe the people out but... due to a culmination of the above mentioned problems, Ganon being a ruthless villain doesn't ever materialize (at least, he's not as scary as he *should* be).Recognize Ocarina of Time for making the 3D Zelda series exist. That's fair. It allowed Wind Waker to eventually be created which in turn made the 3D Zelda formula better starting from that game until now. By 2003 Nintendo was working with the technologically superior Gamecube console which allowed the Zelda series to be fully realized in all major categories (gameplay, graphics, replay value and excitement). I say avoid Ocarina of Time but hey, nobody will listen or agree with me anyway so carry on and have a wonderful day!

El juego para multi jugador de las campanas es muy bueno, muy divertido. Pero los otros juegos de m&uacute;sica no son tan emocionantes, tanto que los ni&ntilde;os r&aacute;pidamente dejaron de jugarlo. Actualmente cuando lo colocamos solo jugamos las campanas. Mis dos hijos est&aacute;n en lecciones de guitarra y piano, esperaba entonces que este juego complementara sus lecciones para desarrollarles de alguna manera el sentido musical, pero el juego es muy aburridor.
el hecho que haya dicho que el juego es decente,tengo que reiterarque tiene muy buenas graficas,jugabilidad media,duracion media,creatividad en los niveles-baja,historia poco interesante,dificultad-alta,retro jugabilidad-bajaprecio del juego-buen precio,recomendacion para que compres el juego-media

TO BE FAIR. Again this was a Christmas gift for our Grandchildren and have not got any feed back on it.
i received the item and it was scratched which was not included in the description.  I returned it and haven't heard anything yet.
