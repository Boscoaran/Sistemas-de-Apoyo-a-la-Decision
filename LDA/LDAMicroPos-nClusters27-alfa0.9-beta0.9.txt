Es simplemente fantastico, yo les puedo asegurar con certeza a mis 33 anos he jugado muchos juegos he tenido muchas consolas pero nunca pense jugar un juego con el 99,99% de perfeccion, como les puedo asegurar esto por el simple hecho que temgo un sistema de sonido 5,1 dolby digital y un televisor de 42" SONY da alta definicion (HDTV)los graficos son ESPECTACULARES, el sonido PERFECTO incluida la musica la inteligencia artificial de los enemigos y aliados es una de las mejores que he visto.Uno se siente profundamente metido en la historia parece una guerra real uno esta asustado tratando de buscar refugio y asi poder dirparar a las hordas interminables de LOCUST y si no disparas el enemigo te rodea y tus visceras terminaran regadas por el suelo.como podran notar soy latino vivo en ECUADOR y debo pensar bien en como invertir mi dinero ya que aqui cuestan alrededor de 80 dolares pero este juego los vale. La verdad muchos de los juegos que vienen con traduccion en espanol son PESIMOS ya que las voces las relizan espanoles y comprenderan que el OSTIA-EY TIO-DISPARAD LAS PIZTOLAS  lo detesto como pasa en GHOST RECON , pero en este juego en espanol es increible parece que por ahi hay un argentino pero aceptable y cuando oigas a los LOCUST decir cuando se acercan PATEASUELOS-OMINIDOS O HUMANOS CON UNA VOZ DE MOUNSTRO MUY BIEN HECHA EN ESPANOL DEBERAS PREPARARTE PARA PELEAR POR TU VIDA y eso que no lo he jugado en ingles ,el juego es un poco corto es verdad con unas 8 o 9 horas de juego lo terminaras.Otro detalle que es un invento nuevo en un genero tan desgastado como el de tiroteo es la mini motosierra en el rifle simplemente matar a los LOCUST con esto  es sanguinariamente adictivo y veras muuuuuucha sangre, a un consejo cuando oigas a un mounstruo decir BOOM mejor ponte a cubierto.Yo adoro los juegos de la WWII como  CALL OF DUTY Y MEDAL OF HONOR EN SUS BUENOS TIEMPOS y a HALO pero dudo que esta vez MASTER CHIEF salga victorioso ESTE SERA EL MEJOR JUEGO DEL ANO SEGURO AHH DISCULPEN POR NO PONER TILDES NI LA N CON LA RAYITA ENCIMA.Ahhhhh me olvidava porque no es perfecto Solo por un pequeno detalle QUE UNO NO SE PUEDE AGACHAR SI NO SE ESTA CUBRIENDO ATRAS DE ALGO
Esta lucha entre el bien y el mal va m&aacute;s all&aacute; de los convencional; hay una mezcla entre intriga, venganza, humor... todo para que te quedes pegado en el juego esperando a ver que es lo que sigue. &iquest;El juego es corto? s&iacute;. Es corto, pero hacerlo m&aacute;s largo era convertirlo en una novela de nunca acabar, as&iacute; que se extiende lo justo.En cuanto al juego en si, el gameplay es bueno, un poco lento a mi parecer, pero nada que te pueda resultar incomodo.El contenido del juego es excelente, armas de destrucci&oacute;n masiva, muertes especiales tipo fatalities (sin tener que combinar botones), enemigos por mont&oacute;n, veh&iacute;culos, y mundos super interesantes para explorar y desbloquear objetos par tu colecci&oacute;n personal.El juego tiene de todo.Ahora bien, en el caso de multiplayer la cosa cambia un poco. Afecta mucho m&aacute;s si vienes acostumbrado a jugar juegos como COD donde el sistema multiplayer es lo mejor. El tema es que es lento conseguir partidas y tambi&eacute;n el juego en s&iacute; una vez que consigues la partida., pero no deja de ser divertido.Este juego merece el 5/5 de las estrellas, no te deja ning&uacute;n desperdicio, est&aacute; hecho para que te quedes pegado...
Excelente control de mando, me hacia falta uno para tener dos de estos en mi consola y poder disfrutar de los juegos en grupo.!! estoy muy contento de tener otro de estos..!!
Simplemente comprenlo es un juego que es necesaro tener al igual que el 2do = ), ya lo veran no se arrepentiran.
Kinect Sport is the best game for family entertainment, have plenty of games, funny gamesEs el mejor juego para la familia, tiene muchos juegos entretenidos, ademas vienen las dos temporadas juntas por un precio increible

Finally, the game is out. The third Forza this generation, better graphics, more cars, and better physics were promised in this iteration of Turn 10's Driving sim. Did they deliver?Oh god yes.-----------This review will have a few sections, this table of contents will help.(enter in ctrl +f dialog box to search)**1** Game mechanics---Graphics---Damage---Menus---Career---Community--------Auction House--------Storefront---Autovista---Freeplay---Marketplace---Driving**2** Online**3** Customization**4** Difficulty & A.I.**5** Sounds**6** Cars**7** Wrap Up**1**Game Mechanics:---Graphics:Great, they do occasionally look surreal, but the gloss textures are excellent, the drive by graphics are decent and the cars themselves are great. The lighting in this game is what really sells the realism, the cars interact with the environment and look like they are supposed to be there. Comparing this feature to the occasionally underwhelming tracks in GT5 and Forza 3 where sometimes the car was better animated than the track, the cars in Forza 4 look right in place on the pavement. Graphical hangups are nonexistent, and animations are fluid. In a word, Forza 4is beautiful.---Damage:Damage returns more or less exactly as Forza 3 had it. The car has prescripted crumple zones and damage is animated cosmetically if you set it, but also internally and performance robbing if you set it as well. The cosmetic damage leaves a lot to be desired, but with see-able damage on 500 + cars i can't complain. Though the damage is weak, it is better than it was in Forza 3. Bumpers and other components cave in and warp much more, and the damage zones are more plentiful allowing the damage to be more localized when hit. T-boning an opponent will leave a few dents in his doors along with much of the paint being stripped on the area hit. Its nothing like Dirt 3 or Grid's damage model though. Choosing to allow damage to performance is much more detrimental, hitting a wall can literally ruin your race, causing damage to the engine, transmission, gear box, brakes, suspension, driveshaft,and body will all cause power, handling, or aerodynamic performance damage. All of this causes lowering of top speed, shift times, braking distance, and a multitude of other issues. This is where Forza leaps into the big leagues as a sim, race clean, or don't finish 1st.---Menus:Forza is set up in a very simplistic manner, with a few main tabs to pick from that open to other tabs, the five main are Career, Community, AutoVista, Free Play, and Marketplace.---Career:Career works here much differently than Forza 3, there is actually a completion of career, and its guided by the announcer. The longer you play, the higher you'll level, the more races you can participate in, and the more places you have access to race. You start as an amateur and progress to the big leagues. after about 1.5 hours I'm 1.2% Should give you a good idea at the length. (300+ events in event list)In this tab, you can do all of the stuff you'd expect, buy sell cars, tune cars, upgrade cars, and see your stats.---Community:Play online with people around the world here.You can also make car clubs (like guilds for you Rpg people) to race with, check your rivals and leaderboards,  and use the auction house and the storefront here.For new players:--------Auction house:Exactly what it sounds like, a bidding place to purchase cars other players are selling. Usually you can turn good profit on nice cars here. Ironically you can usually save money buying here as well.--------Storefront:A player's place to sell their custom content like pictures, liveries, tunes, and custom vinyl work.---Autovista:Kinect featured but usable with a controller, Autovista is a first person look at some of the coolest cars in the game, and probably the closest thing to sitting in a Ferrari 458 Italia as you'll ever get. With voice over and 100% view-ability of components of the car. Its awesome for any gear head who wants to see these exotics close up.---Free Play:Basically an arcade mode, go race where you want using a car. Use this mode to test drive cars you want to buy buy can't afford yet.---Marketplace:One of the best Xbox live integrations for DLC I've seen, actually shows you what you're buying and what it is. Nice addition for those inevitable car and track packs you might not like.---Driving:For the most important part of a racing experience, this has to be spot on. It is, this is the first time I've seen a competitor really give GT a run for its money in the physics dept. High powered cars behave uncontrollably and require a knowing and practiced touch around corners, while underpowered cars must be mastered in the corners as well, as their weak powered engines depend on cornering to get fast lap times. The cars behave predictably and correctly in almost every way, and each one handles differently. Tuning works the way it should, and is intuitive and speaks to both gearheads and newbs alike. Driving is also fully customizable, allowing the user to put as much or as little burden of sim on themselves as they wish. The more assists you take off, the more money you earn in career.Forza does a great job as a simulator, but does fall flat in the rollover physics as one particular glaring flaw, as occasionally the car will just up and flip for no good reason if you hit a wall hard enough. Bit as often as you'll flip, I don't think this is enough to remove the game's physics engine realism.**2** Online:The multiplayer from 3 returns, but with one distinction. an extra gleaming gold tab on the find race tab. "User-Created Races" Basically, this is the room from forza 2 we missed so much, the ability to do whatever we want as a host. Sure we can't choose who the host is, but now options can be tweaked again. Thank you turn 10 for listening to us and giving us our player lobbies back. The best of forza 3's seek and play server usage combined with the option to play like forza 2. If this was holding you back, be scared no more.**3** Customization:Forza returns with its massive set of internal and external customization options, from engine swaps to body kits and spoilers, if you can do it in real life, you pretty much can do it here. Also comes with the best livery editor ever put in a racing game. over 1000 usable shape spots on most surfaces of your car means some awesome, detailed liveries, and some of the coolest things you've ever seen on a car. Your old stuff from Forza 3 is also importable to 4, downloaded a lot of custom vinyls? You won't lose them. Finally, a fully customizable and spectrumed paint creator is right there at your fingertips to paint your car any color you want. Forza has all of the tools for infinite possibilities for personalization, meaning no 2 users can easily make the same car. The best part? Upload your creations to your storefront to make money if they're good enough. If there is a market for your stuff, people will buy and you'll become known on the leaderboards as a tuner, creator, photographer or replay capturer. In addition, performing on the track will net you achievements and driving bonuses such as doing 20 perfect passes. Do these challenges and you unlock names and avatars for your forza playercard. Players can look at this and see what kind of driver you are or how far you've played in your career. All there for even more customization.**4** Difficulty and A.I.As a whole this game can can be really hard, but you have to set the difficulty to be hard yourself. So if you're really good, up your challenges and remove the assists for a challenging experience, or add some assists or lower the AI difficulty if you're having trouble. The game will reward better drivers with more cash and EXP though. So its in your best interest to try to get better to remove your training wheels.The AI is okay, its could be better, but its got a lot more life than the likes of GT where cars pretty much never fall out of line or differentiate from the best line. Cars here will get spooked, screw up corners and avoid traffic and you, and also will take aggressive action to keep position on occasion. It depends on the driver, as each is different. (able to be looked up in the opponents tab in my profile)**5** SoundsSounds are great, the soundtrack is good and upbeat and contains a good set of racing music, mostly as ambiance rather than sing along music, the menu music is nice, lower key music that's still just tense enough to not be annoying or grating on your ears.Engines and ambient sounds are well done and modified depending on car stats and mods, as you upgrade turbos, intakes and exhausts and other components the exhaust notes and engine sounds change. Engines also sound different (ford v8 vs a chevy v8) I used a Corvette Z06 06' and a Mustang Shelby GT500 10' to test this. Both sound good, and have their distinctive roars, without being the same.**6** Carsover 500 with the install disc and more planned for November etc. Every type of racing archetype is there, Muscle cars (in abundance!) Tuners, exotics, trucks, SUV's, Nascar (stock car shells), GT1, 2, 3,and Prototype racers are available. There is something for anyone. The Performance Index or P.I. also makes a return, rating cars from the cream of the crap to the cream of the crop on a scale from 100 to 999 with the index being split into F, E, D, C, B, A, S, R3, R2, and R1. I'm Unsure if the X class makes a return. The class often determines whether or not your car qualifies for an event, if it does, often similar cars will be racing with you and races will be more challenging, if you overclass, or underclass for an event if it is allowed, the race will be much easier/harder respectably.*side note* the average run of the mill car can be used in many, many events rather than just a few like in GT, often one car can be used in 10+ events stock and even more if customized to different specs or classes.**7** Wrap upForza is a way better game in every way than 3 was, more races, more events, the return of public custom lobbies, as well as the usability of the server system like that of Forza 3, with ability to play with only friends in customizable private races as well. With solid driving physics, graphics, car selection, and sound, a better interface, and massive customizability, its hard not to make a recommendation to any racing fan, If you're unsure there is a free demo on X-Box Live, give it a whirl to test it out. Otherwise, its a lot of game for $60.UPDATE 11/03/11:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Turn 10 has released some DLC:The November Speed Pack, including these cars:1957 Chevy Bel Air1992 GMC Typhoon2013 Ford Focus ST2011 VW Scirocco R2011 Audi RS3 Sportback2012 Dodge Charger SRT82012 Aston Martin Virage2012 Lamborghini Aventador LP700-42011 Ferrari #62 Risi Competizione F458 Italia2011 Audi #2 Audi Sport Team Joest R15++ TDIMore thoughts: I missed this on my review, but, Porsche is not licensed in this game despite the cars being created for it. Also, the cars past R3 when tuned from normal cars become a MASSIVE challenge to drive without assists. I've got a RWD BMW M3 pushing 700 horses with the new M5 engine in it. and it MOVES, but its so hard to keep her under control. In short, despite its readily increasing and sometimes frustrating challenge, Forza remains playable and awesome. I do intend to give the DLC packs as addendum to this review. as I have done. Game on.UPDATE 12/16/11:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------More cars:2011 Suzuki #1 Monster Sport SX42011 Mazda RX-8 R32011 Ford F-150 SVT Raptor1967 Chevrolet Chevelle SS-3961977 Ford Escort RS18001981 Volkswagen Scirocco S1986 Alfa Romeo Spider Quadrifoglio Verde1988 Pontiac Fiero GT2010 Maserati GranTurismo MC GT41957 Maserati 300 SMore updates: This game is stupendously long.

Forza will have porches sometime in may, as a whole, the DLC have added 60 new cars, some awesome, some eh. But as a whole has added more to the community and the car packs are more than adequately worth the price. I'm still playing this game, and I'm only at a 47% completion rating. I can't justify this purchase enough. Thank you Turn 10, for this game, for something to do in the wee hours in the morning and above all for doing every car fanatic well. This game, is the best racing game I've ever purchased. Its long, expands over decades, and even has the golden years of racing highlighted. (60's) This game is for racing and car lovers, and can be played by anyone with the willingness to learn it. With that, its DLC set is done. See you again, post Porsche pack.
This is one of the best racing games I have ever played.  Being an automotive enthusiast in "real life," I am also a big fan of simulation racing, and back in my PS2 days Gran Turismo was my game of choice.  Since I lack a PS3 at the moment, I cannot try the new GT5, but Forza has become my new favorite for the time being.  I first played this game shortly after its debut in 2007, but it belonged to a roommate and I never finished it.  When I became cognizant of the release of Forza 3 in 2009, my new roommate and I teamed up to complete FM2, doing so mere hours before the new game was released.  Now that Forza 4 is coming out, I have made it my mission to once again tackle this game AND Forza 3, bringing both to 100% completion on my own.That's right:  despite owning Forza 3 and having completed over 75% of that game, I am still enthusiastically playing Forza 2.  It's really that good.Forza 2 offers the same formula as many other racing games, but the particular way it delivers this content is quite appealing.  The game contains over 300 cars (counting DLC, which is included in the Platinum Hits version of the game).  There is a great selection of cars, with most popular vehicles included such as the Ferrari Enzo, Lamborghini Murcielago, Lotus Exige, Corvette Z06, Porsche 911 Turbo, Audi R8, Ford GT, and BMW M3.  In addition, a few lesser-known but historically significant sports cars are included such as the Lotus Carlton, Buick Grand National, VW Corrado, and BMW CSL.  This is obviously only a fraction of the cars, but illustrates the diversity of the game.  Inexpensive "tuner" vehicles such as Honda Civics are also included, as are a plethora of professionally built race cars (Le Mans & Touring, but no rally or F1) and several branded tuner cars such as Mine's Skylines and a Top Secret Supra and Silvia.Forza 2, and its successors, classify the cars by a ranking system known as "Performance Index."  Each car is assigned a performance "number," based on characteristics such as handling and acceleration; each range of numbers is then given a letter "class" to quickly judge the overall rank of the car, and to provide restriction for race events.  For example, class "A" ranges from P.I. of 700 to 850.  The cars can then be upgraded with various parts, which will increase the number accordingly.Upgrading cars is a smooth and easy process, but can be subjected to careful scrutiny to ensure the best overall performance.  Upgrades include engine parts, suspension and weight reduction, tires and wheels, and spoilers.  In the latter, some cars offer aftermarket body kits, while others can be modified only with adjustable race ("Forza style") wings, splitters, and diffusers.  The various upgrades are offered under real life brand names, such as HKS, K&N;, AWE Tuning, Bilstein, Pirelli, BBS, and many more.  While this has little effect on the actual performance of such modifications, it lends a realistic feel to the upgrade process.Cars can be painted in nearly any desired shade, and several dozen layers of graphics can be custom-designed and installed; this feature in particular gained considerable acclaim since its basic introduction in Forza 1.Once a car is purchased and upgraded, if desired, it can be raced in a variety of events ranging from short and easy "Proving Grounds" events to lengthy and challenging "Endurance" events.  The broad event categories each contain a number of race series, each of which has 3 to 5 individual races.  Completing each race awards money (credits) and experience points; completing each series awards a monetary bonus and a car (prize cars remain locked in the dealership until they are won).  Finally, completing each EVENT type gives an XBox Live challenge and an even larger monetary bonus.The amount of money given in races depends on the difficulty level selected; AI difficulty can be set to easy, medium, or hard, and assists such as ABS, Traction Control, Stability Control, and a "recommended racing line" can be turned on or off.  The game also allows manual or automatic shifting for all cars, with manual giving a small bonus.  Various AI drivers can be hired to perform races for the player, though they will take anywhere from 55-100% of the winnings depending on their skill level.  This is useful either for tedious races, or for racking up money to buy cars while doing something else.  I personally prefer to do all the races myself (to maximize winnings and "experience the whole game"), but I frequently use the hired driver to do completed endurance races for money while I am busy doing some other activity.As races are completed, the player gains experience points, which level them up.  The game is well balanced so that if all races are performed only once, the level-up process will continue throughout most of the game.  There are 50 levels, each of which requires more points to achieve, and each level gives an award such as a discount on cars or parts; every five levels achieved gives a bonus prize car, which varies depending on which region (Europe, North America, Asia) the player chooses at the beginning of the career mode.  The region can be changed during the career, but for a substantial amount of credits; the only things affected by the choice of region are the prize cars given for leveling up, and the types of cars which become discounted after a certain number of levels.  Races are identical.Cars themselves can also gain up to 5 "Reputation Levels," each of which gives a further discount on various upgrade parts.  These discounts can be quite useful, as some parts for exotic cars tend to cost a great deal.The game's structure is well organized as described, but how about the actual gameplay mechanics?  In this regard, Forza 2 also delivers strong results.  Game physics are quite good considering its age.  I estimate that the newer Forza games are somewhat more realistic, in that they seem to communicate tire effects better, and also allow rollover accidents.  However, those in Forza 2 are certainly not bad, nor are they arcade-quality.  Driving must be done cleanly and carefully to achieve good lap times; running off the road not only gives a lap penalty, but also slows cars down significantly.  In particular, the grass and dirt around some tracks is modeled to behave like "quicksand," in that it instantly slows cars to a mere crawl, making shortcuts a non-option.  The game also includes a good damage model.  Obviously, there is not enough computing power to accurately replicate 100+ mph wrecks, but contact between cars, rear-ending events, and accidental wall scrapes take their toll both visually and physically; in R1 (Le Mans Prototype) race cars, small amounts of damage to aero devices can render the cars nearly undriveable.AI in the game is the typical dim-witted lot found in most of these types of games (at least from this era), but is not entirely mindless.  As many times as they rear-end you, they will also stop to avoid collisions, and some try unique and aggressive passing maneuvers.  However, they also tend to follow a fairly fixed path on the track, and in most events there are plenty of places for the player to take corners much more quickly than the AI.  Despite this, some races are nearly impossible with the AI difficulty set to "hard," providing a great deal of challenge.Graphics are remarkable.  While Forza 3 and 4 offer better graphics, the changes are mostly limited to track detail and lighting.  Forza 2 has carefully replicated each car with precise and crisp details.  It might not have the best lighting effects, but everything is sharp and clear, not blocky or poorly rendered.  Only some of the trees and other track features take on a tacky 2D appearance, but it does not detract from the game experience, at least not in my opinion.  The one graphical feature that is severely lacking is animated pit stops.  Gran Turismo 4, a previously released competitor in the market, provided this, whereas Forza 2 involves cars being magically repaired in a ghost town pit lane with no crew; surprisingly, Forza 3 did the same.The game features two other modes, arcade and multiplayer.  Arcade provides quick races, split screen competition, and a series of time trial events.  Multiplayer, of course, offers online racing.  However, as of 2012, this mode is no longer available, as the servers were permanently shut down to accommodate Forza 4.  That being said, however, Forza 2 provides such an excellent single player experience that unless someone is ONLY interested in online gaming, the value is still great.In summary, Forza 2 delivers a solid and time-consuming single-player experience that should please any car enthusiast with its broad scope of cars, upgrades, and race events.  While multiplayer is no longer active, the game still holds good value as a classic in the racing genre.  I actually prefer the upgrade system to that of Forza 3, and while the rewind feature in Forza 3 is handy, Forza 2 seems like a more challenging and "raw" experience without it.  In the end, Forza 2, 3, and 4 will all grace my game collection as solid racing titles that I would recommend to anyone who loves simulation racing.
Forza Motorsport 4Having maxed out my profile to level 50 in Forza 3, I was pleasantly surprised to see Forza 4 recognized this and gave me some goodies like free gift cars and 60,000 credits. It is far easier to earn free cars in Forza 4 than in 3, because each level gives you a choice of several cars but many of them are shoddy older vehicles (ahem, I meant classics or retro). It is also easier to earn credits through race bonuses or affinity bonuses. The manufacturer affinity is now no longer capped at level 5, but at level 5 you get 100% discounts on upgrades which means you can customize your cars without being charged. I always felt that it was unfair to spend that much money in Forza 3 to find out that your performance index went over the limit for that class.The controls are amazingly intuitive. I did not tweak any of the settings for my controller, but the layout is a major concern. In Forza 3, I ran Layout 5 which uses "X" as the handbrake, and "A" as the rear view. For some unknown reason, Forza 4's Layout 5 is the same except "X" is now the rear view, and "A" is the hand brake. Needless to say I always accidentally use the handbrake when I want to look behind, or I look behind when I want to tap the handbrake. I find it idiotic for the developers to lock us into fixed controller configurations versus totally custom setups.The very first race you start in the game forces you to use an unfamiliar controller setup with all of the driver assists enabled. I was not a happy camper as I tend to brake late and slide the rear. The AI difficulty is kind of weird. In the World Tour, the difficulty is progressive. So as you start off, the AI is fairly easy. As you progress, the AI starts to overpower you with shoddy cars or overpowers you in spec racing which makes no sense. It is not possible to adjust the difficulty in the World Tour, but it is possible in the regular events. This makes no sense whatsoever, but if Microsoft had anything to do with it, then it totally makes sense. Just like printing Outlook calendars where you can never have the previous month and next month in the corner of the calendar, or how all default "All-Day" events have 18 hour reminder times which can't be changed because it was made by Microsoft.Speaking more about the AI difficulty, I found that Forza 4 and Forza 3 have the same levels of difficulty. I normally use Medium because I want to relax and have some fun. The Hard setting is hard because the AI just gets on your six and can overpower you if you open up a hole for them. In the Professional setting, I've given up because even in Spec series racing where everyone has the same car, the AI will actually overpower your car in the straights as if they had extra power from the engines. The AI makes mistakes in the Medium mode but sometimes they act strange and start to become ultra competitive. I'm just playing Forza 4 to learn the tracks and enjoy myself, not to become King of Forza 4.Some of my other complaints include the lack of the Le Mans Bugatti circuit which was in Forza 3, which was a lot of fun and happens to be used in the MotoGP series. The Indianapolis Grand Prix circuit, also used in MotoGP, is found in Forza 4 but it is somehow run in reverse. I am not sure why that was done, because after playing MotoGP 09/10 for a year plus and watching the MotoGP races, I was used to it running in the anti-clockwise route.Forza 4 has a similar feel to NFS Shift 2, especially with the race starting sequence. Forza 3 felt a bit different, more bland or sterile compared to Forza 4, which is seemingly more vibrant with its menus and Auto Vista feature. I really wish the player's engine doesn't rev in the starting sequence because it messes up the launch sequence.  You want a continuous RPM, not a bouncing RPM. The speedometer and tachometer in Forza 4 is difficult to read because of the white/bright text and colors and actually fades out on the bright tracks. The framerate of the game actually slows down with the rear view mirror enabled! It clearly shows the limitations of the Xbox 360 GPU hardware.Some new features in Forza 4 include the multi-class race, where you can have two different performance classes running on the same track (like S and D) which creates some interesting situations. The Top Gear bowling pins and soccer ball games are fun, but not that mandatory. The Top Gear test track was brutalized by the developers with the addition of fake barriers that don't exist in real life. I sat there and pondered why they would do that, and assumed it was because the game needs some type of definition for the course and to determine where you "get off the track". At least it is better than not having the Top Gear test track in the game!One of the gripes I have is with realistic engine sounds. The GT500's supercharger is not very audible in Forza 4, and I recall it being somewhat audible in Forza 3. In real life, the familiar whine of the Eaton is very audible inside the cabin, let alone outside the car. The rich sound of the blower should be replicated for a better experience.Another gripe I have is that most of the powerful cars are very difficult to drive using the controller. In Forza 3, I have no problems pushing the "A" cars to the limit with Traction Control and ABS shut off. This includes the Audi R8 V10 and Ferrari F430. In Forza 4, the "A" cars and beyond (S, R3, etc...) become extremely touchy with the throttle and brakes. I find myself easily locking up or not using enough brakes, or losing traction very quickly. Once I enabled Trac Ctrl and ABS, the cars became totally drivable and I was leaving the AI in the dust in the world tour. I find that it is hard to tell when the tires are at their point of adhesion with the game and Xbox controller. In real life, there are clues like the sudden relaxation of the steering feedback or sounds from the tires, or your butt meter tells you the car is yawing.The Downloadable Content (DLC) for Forza 4 consists of extra cars so far. The November and December car packs are now available, and there is a modicum of decent cars with plenty of junky, ahem I mention retro classics, cars as well. The Ford Raptor, Pontiac Fiero, Chevrolet Chevelle, and Suzuki SX4 Pike's Peak race car are some of the more interesting cars, but note that after spending Microsoft Points on the DLC packs or cars, you must use in-game credits to buy the cars!A Xbox Live Gold Membership is required to post videos, download gift cars, and buy/sell auction cars. Compounded with numerous bugs in the game that corrupt your save game files preventing you from saving replay movies, it gets on my nerves. I had a Gold membership last year when playing Forza 3, but I quickly realized that the Gold membership wasn't worth the price last year. Microsoft raised the price of the membership for this year and I didn't bother to renew it. So far the gift cars from Turn 10 aren't very good, and the DLC cars aren't enticing enough to convince me to shell out the coin for a Gold membership. I do have some free trial Gold membership codes, so I plan to do all the "shopping" at once on a free trial to avoid paying the exorbitant membership fee. It's just frustrating that a Gold membership is required to do all of these static things, I could understand Gold being required for online race sessions, but to download a gift car or to buy/sell auction cars? Outrageous.Overall: 4/5 stars. Forza 4 is a lot like Forza 3, and shows the limitations of the Xbox 360 hardware. There are some nice new features, but again many frustrating aspects are back or are new and mainly related to AI difficulty and controller layout. It's a fun game for sure, and if you have not tried Forza 3, and you are a gearhead/petrolhead, you'll miss out if you don't try Forza 4. If you have played Forza 3, Forza 4 is worth the price of admission.
I'm a Forza 4 addict and this game is the reason I bought Xbox One.  So hopefully that helps you know where I'm coming from.The Cars:Amazing.  Simply amazing.  By far the most detail I've seen from a console game.  Every car can also now be ogled in ForzaVista which had me playing with my Mazda MX-5 for quite some time opening doors, retracting the roof, revving the engine, an flipping the headlights on and off.  The selection is indeed a giant step down from FM4 in terms of quantity, but I can forgive that given the insane level of detail and the fact that despite a limited selection, they made pretty good choices on what to put in.  It is not a glut of supercars, but is instead the typical Forza mix of everyday cars, supercars, hypercars, racing cars, and classics.  There are a few omissions that I found rather glaring right off the bat, for example no Lancia Stratos and no MK6 or 7 VW GTI.  These can be forgiven though given such tasteful additions as an Ariel Atom V8 and (finally) a North American 2013 MX-5, and other cool cars like the insane Renault Clio V6.Driving:  Forza veterans will feel at home here, sort of.  All the assists except rewind can be turned off as I prefer, and the manual w/clutch option is still there.  However the difficulty of driving without assists (or as the Topgear crew might say "the electronic nannies") has been dramatically increased.  Between the tighter feeling tracks and the larger number of opponents and the fact that my MX-5 was very hard to control with the assists turned off, there was a good and satisfying amount of tension in the races, despite the presence of the rewind safety net.  Fortunately, with the increased difficulty, the money prizes were reworked and now as long as you net a podium finish (3rd or above) you will get the maximum money prize.  Damage does not detract from your winnings now, but using the rewind feature does.  The rumble triggers also really enhance the experience, I can feel when I am about to break traction, the thrum of the engine as I shift, and the pulsating as I lock up my brakes.  It all adds up to make a thrilling, and challenging but fair driving experience, especially from the vastly improved cockpit view.Upgrades:  Nothing has really changed here except they are no longer free if you get affinity level 4 on a particular make of car.  You still have your basic options of Quick Upgrade, Engine, Platform & Handling, Drivetrain, Tires & Rims, Aero & Appearance, and of course my favorite Conversion.Paint:  Here is where some long desired changes have finally been implemented.  You can finally paint stock wheels.  And finally matte is an option (yay for matte white wheels!).  There is the usual huge selection of vinyls, and now you can fit 3000 shapes on each side except front and rear bumper which are limited to 1000.  Additionally, there is just a huge number of paint options.  Gloss, matte, metal flake, two tone polish, two tone semigloss, two tone matte, carbon fiber, camos, wood, chrome, polished aluminum, gold, the number of options is simply fantastic, and I can't wait to see what people create.Money and Misc Stuff:  A few changes here.  First the vehicle performance index has been changed slightly.  Not a huge deal, but the ratings don't seem to translate to previous Forzas.  Money is earned by racing, and if you put something up on storefront from what I understand, but now it is also earned by your Drivatar, a representation of you that is based off your driving habits and earns money when you are not in game.  Money is also earned when you increase your driver level as before.  The affinity system has been reworked though, and now for example when I race a Mazda and level up Mazda's affinity, I will get a percentage based affinity bonus of cash with every race I finish in a Mazda.Menu and interface:  It took a few minutes to get sorted on this, but the new cleaner and quicker menu system is a VAST improvement over previous efforts.Conclusion:  As a long time Forza fan I found a lot to love about Forza 5 just from my few hours playing.  I will be back with updates if my opinion changes on anything, but I can honestly say this is the most impressive Forza game yet.  Above all else it is the driving experience and the cars beauty both audio and visual that truly floors me here.  If you are obsessed with cars as I am I can't recommend this game enough!Update: I found a few things that bug me.  Number one as others have mentioned is microtransactions.  I have never liked the token system, and sadly now they're available to use on everything that you use in game CR for.  It's easy enough to ignore, but if you are impatient and want the million dollar cars immediately you won't be happy, and you'll probably be tempted to buy tokens, please I ask that you don't as that will only lead to more microtransactions down the road.The second thing that bugs me is that aside from the nice steel book and a small number of exclusive cars (that will undoubtedly become available to everyone later) there is zero reason to get the Limited Edition.  VIP membership is nice I guess, but it doesn't seem to have a huge benifit yet other than being gifted a few cars.Thirdly, ForzaVista is not quite as fleshed out as I would have liked.  On a lot of the low end cars you can't even pop the hood or the trunk, or even the rear passenger doors, and yet on some you can.  There isn't the nice full body of narration either like there was in Forza 4, and Clarkson no longer talks about each car.  Instead you get one blurb for each car by a random woman.  Still great that every car can be looked at, just wish they'd added more narration.Fourth, the cockpit view when racing is only visible in the forward quarter again.  I was really hoping that since they had to model every interior of every car for ForzaVista that they would make the cockpit view so that when you look behind you would see the rear windscreen, rear seats/interior, but instead you look behind and it's a bumper camera which really damges the immersiveness of driving with the cockpit view.Fifth, there is no storefront or auction.  When I think back I remember hearing about this, but I guess I forgot about it and didn't realize how much I'd miss it.  I used to make some awesome custom camo vinyl groups in FM4 and now I no longer have a storefront to show them off.  These were two features that really should have been kept (regardless of the money glitching), and it's baffling to me that they ditched these staples of the online Forza community.Sixth, and final point, despite clearly having the ability to render headlights switched on, and seeing some cars race with running lights on, there is no option to turn them on/off while racing.  L3 and R3 are even unbound and free to do this.  This is a pretty minor point, but there are some tracks, like Bathurst which is set at dusk, where racing with headlights on would look really cool.A couple of other good things to report however.  First is money is real easy to come by.  Race payouts aren't any higher, but I seem to level up quicker, and after roughly 15-20 hours I have 1.5 million CR in the bank and roughly 1 million CR worth of car in the garage (not counting gifted cars).  Secondly, they brought back and improved the rivals system slightly.  Even in regular racing you are always kept aprised of who's time you beat, and who's time is up next.  Thirdly, the Grand Prix and F1 cars are great and, based on what I know about them, accurate.  You have to keep your speed high to maintain grip (just like the real thing, speed is needed to keep the tires hot and sticky and the downforce high) and while they don't disintegrate if you crash they are extrememly fragile and even a moderate impact can seriously impact the vehicle's performance.  Fourth, I am just really enjoying savoring each car I buy.  Despite this game's flaws (some of which are quite serious), I cannot help but enjoy it.  This is why I plan to keep my rating at five stars.  Yes there are six things which I listed that would make this experience near perfect, but I am someone genuinely obsessed with cars, and this game itches that scratch better than any other game in recent memory.
Before I begin, this may get wordy, If you're experiencing a severe case of TLDR, head down to the bottom for a quick summary.  I tend to be thorough, and that can be long winded, and I apologize for that. Anyway, on to the review.So what do you get when you cherry pick programmers and artists from turn 10, Bizarre, Codemasters, and other racing studios, sit them down In front of a set of computers and give them Microsoft's Forza Prize winnings to design a game? Forza Horizon. A comprehensive, open world game that is accessible, exceptionally beautiful, delivers in all the fronts it says, and somehow does it with very few drawbacks. I guarantee you, this is the game Test Drive Unlimited WANTED to be. Enough! To the Review!Gameplay:Controls:Controls as you may expect are pretty straightforward. If you've played Forza, they're the same, word for word. If you haven't, the control stick (left) determines direction of the car, A is Handbrake, and the triggers left and right brake and accelerate respectively. It's straightforward and easy to use.Technical:When speaking on the technical aspects of the engine used to make this game, I have to admit this is one of the most STABLE games I've played, Literally ZERO framerate drops, no clipping,In addition, the Complete Forza Physics engine returns, the cars don't feel any different, the assists, like before can be tweaked. With all of them on, the game becomes very accessible, but when all of them are off, the game becomes hard, especially when racing very high powered machines. This game makes no compromises, its arcade on paper, but it's quite sim when you sit down and ask it to be.Menus:I can REALLY tell codemasters exercised their hands here. The menu feels like Grid, Dirt, and all of their other 4 lettered awesome racing games. The menus even so are coherent, deliberate, and very detailed and immersive. (It's odd how a race event becomes a bit more interesting when there is a sweet looking card thingie showing you the event.) The one gripe I have though is that the menu CAN be cumbersome, and I don't like how it has to load a car fully before you can buy it, but all in all, it's a minor whine, and even so, the menu looks and controls great.Cars:Overall, Forza Horizon Brings MUCH less cars to the table than Forza 4 does, but many of the cars in Forza 4 are recent saloons or hatches that aren't rare or impressive, the list brought here contains primarily the best of the best, and is a very refined list for manufacturers. For instance, the Dino for Ferrari does not make an appearance, but the GTO does, the Civic Makes ONE appearance, the Golf though, the Iconic Hot Hatch has multiple appearances. Still, many cars that MAY be your favorites don't appear, but even so, many excellent and Iconic cars do, and I'm SURE more are on the way as DLC. Still, the game is huge and well detailed, and even THIS many cars is a lot, you shouldn't get bored of them and you should have at least one or two favorites available to you.The Festival:To put this easily, the game begins at the start of the Horizon Festival, a Big event at the Core of the world this takes place in, very much so based on the Roads of Colorado in the United States. The festival is a celebration of music, cars and drivers and as such has normal and special events that occur over the course of the game based on your progression. As you continue racing, you'll earn more "wristbands" the corresponding color signifying your "rank" in the festival. People with a green Wristband have more privileges and can access more races in the festival than Yellow wristband holders do. To earn wristbands, you have to race in the festival events, based on your position, you'll earn more points and work towards the new wristband faster or slower depending on your placing. It's not the most riveting system, but I pushes you along. Obviously as you progress, races get more involved and the stakes get higher, and the ultimate goal is to Knock Darius off his high horse and become the new champion of the festival.The WorldThe world contains a lot of stuff besides the festival, Barn finds which net you old cars for free, but you have to find them, 200+ Discoverable roads to drive on, Racers all over the place to find and challenge. Special Horizon Festival waypoints which have 3 events a piece and can upgrade your car, or be fast travelled to. The world also has 100 breakable upgrade signs, each dropping upgrade costs by 1% for each you find and take out, Colorado also has a fully integrated day and night cycle, with nighttime having illegal street racing to participate in, speed traps for stretches of road and cameras for high speed snapshots for leaderboards,  and Finally, the game has Street Cred, an indefinitely increasable skill point counter that keeps track of just about all the stuff you do, from sideswiping signs, breaking benches and fences, to just barely dodging traffic. Doing this earns you points to reduce your popularity rating from 250 (nobody on the subway) to 1 (the most popular guy in town) and also unlocks challenges which when completed earn you credits, and as you progress up the ranks you get to participate in more and more ridiculous invite only events such as racing planes or helicopters. In short, there is a LOT to do.What's the Same?Well, the driving physics is yanked right out of Forza 4, and its implemented perfectly, rollover returns and the full customization options that forza 4 gave return as well, from swaps to body kits, its all there. Damage is on permanent cosmetic though, which drops a bit of realism for the series, but in a game like this, it's almost necessary to scrap this. Still, it'd have been nice. The driving cockpit is also back; all cars have a full cockpit view. The biggest omission though is tuning, no cars are tweak-able, not even tire pressure. It's a big omission and I'm unsure yet how much of a change this will have in multiplayer.Can I play with other people?Yes, yes you can, though the interface is clunkier than it should be, and you can't go there from the Horizon in game menu and instead the title menu, the online matchmaking works, is fun and its exceptionally well balanced between funky casual stuff to do like infection and actual competitive racing.So how's the game look?The game is exceptionally pretty, with MILES of digital road; gorgeous lighting and super well detailed effects, cars, and feeling of speed. Forza Horizon is a great looking game. Not only that but its SMOOTH, no drops in frame rate at all even as Bugatti Veyron and SS Aero Speeds. I urge you, try the demo to see how it looks. It's exceptional.SummaryAll in all, Forza Horizon is an exceptional Racing game that set out to deliver the Forza Driving experience, an Authentic feeling drive, with the virtual reality of being able to go anywhere you want however you want with no consequences. All the while give players the chance to drive their dream cars however they want, the ability to customize and drive them however they wish, and a comprehensive set of events and challenges that are entertaining. It also give you plenty to do, exploration, challenging your friends on and off the track, and In odd, addictive events. It offers the accessibility of an Arcade racer, with the challenge and feel of a Simulator. Not only that but It does all of that at a steady, great, non-dipping Frame rate with excellent visuals,  and though the story is a bit lackluster and the main opponents mostly punk-ish. The game is very solid at what it sets out to do which is create a fun, open world for racers and car lovers to explore and enjoy.The Edition:The Special Edition includes more cars, the typical Forza VIP pass and a few more uh... Cars, To be honest, except for the tin and that Topless Aventador (HAPPY FAIC!), there's not much to really justify the purchase. Still it's a great game and the metal tin looks really nice.It's truly an excellent title. Playground games did an excellent job with this game, lets hope they stick around.

I get on kicks every now and again. Early last year it was D&D; games, before that it was first person sneakers (Deus Ex, Thief, No One Lives Forever, etc.). Right now it's Giant Death Robots.MechWarrior 4 fits firmly into the tradition established by its predecessors: you're given a mission and a selection of 'Mechs (40-foot-tall, vaguely anthropomorphic walking tanks) and lancemates to execute it with. Completing missions successfully and nailing the secondary and tertiary objectives nets you more weapons, equipment, and 'Mechs to employ in future missions. Gameplay feels like a slowed-down, cerebral first-person shooter - it's not so simulation-like that it takes half an hour to learn to walk your 'Mech out of the hangar, but even the nimblest, most trigger-happy player will be quickly stymied unless he learns how to think tactically.Also, as is to be expected, the game inherits many of its various quirks from its granddaddy, the dice-and-miniatures BATTLETECH game. There's the overriding concern with managing your robot's heat disposal - do you spend those extra five tons on more lasers and missiles, or do you add more heat sinks to keep the machine running longer without stalling out? There's the endless indecipherable acronyms for everything - a term like "Clan Ultra LBX AC 20" may accurately represent the real-life military's preoccupation with senseless acronyms, but the term does little to inform players that it refers to what amounts to a really big gun. And then there's the dauntingly large and impossibly convoluted BATTLETECH backstory, which while entertaining to those with the will to suss it all out, leaves everyone else benumbed and without a frame of reference to appreciate most of the goings-on (aside from Stuff Blows Up Real Good, anyway).So yeah, MW4 carries a lot of baggage. But that's okay, because, all other considerations aside, it's a great big hoot of a game. Graphics this time out are lovely, even given that the game was released in late 2000. Weapon effects are tops - lasers generate groovy light-sourcing, impacting missiles leave obscuring gouts of thick smoke around their targets (which can be useful to effect a quick getaway), and PPC blasts cause your opponent to spark and trail electric arcs. There's a big selection of gorgeously-rendered environments to stomp around in, from lunar wasteland to snowy peaks to swamps to coastal harbor towns. (A welcome addition: the coastal levels let you wade your 'Mech a couple miles out into the water to do battle with enormous oceangoing battleships and cruisers.) Particularly well-done this time are the urban levels, which are finally done correctly to scale and give a nice tingly feeling of paranoia and claustrophobia (you never know when a 100-ton Atlas might come stomping out from behind a building).Enemy AI this time is generally very good, with enemies using the right weapons at the right ranges, taking cover behind buildings and hills, grabbing the high ground to pound you with long-range missiles and Gauss rounds, etc. Your lancemates are actually people of value this time around, and they really do behave according to their skill profile (the guy who's a crack shot actually opts to snipe, and the girl with a huge score in piloting actually runs rings around her targets, etc.)What came as a surprise to me was the quality of MW4's story. Previous MechWarrior games too often felt like abstract military exercises, with mission briefings coming to you in blocks of jargon-filled text that too often failed not only to convey a story, but even to be understandable to people not steeped in BATTLETECH lore. While it's true that MW4 employs dodgy full-motion video backed by even dodgier 'actors', the narrative is clean, focused, and perfectly sensible - your lancemates become actual characters rather than collections of statistics, and your enemies are hissable villains rather than abstract bullseyes under your target reticle. It's admirably supported by a lovely musical score that veers between violent, pounding guitar riffs (like most of the music in MW2 and Mercenaries) and swelling orchestral themes.It's a great game and I give it an unqualified recommendation to anyone with a muscular enough PC.

Once again the Mechwarrior torch has been passed on, once in the hands of Activision for three games-Mechwarrior 2, then Ghost Bear Legacy and finally Mercenaries, it was handed off to Microprose who bumbled Mechwarrior 3 on a rather grand scale. Now that Fasa has swallowed by Microsoft as yet another franchise under their banner. That said, "Mechwarrior 4: Vengeance" is a worthy successor to Mechwarrior 2, and pigeon holes into the overall Battletech story line perfectly. Though that story line is degenerating thanks to bad writing in the form of Battletech novels and RPG source material in the Federated Commonwealth of House Steiner and House Davion has been shattered, pretty much guaranteeing that everything will return to the same old boring status quo of five Successor Houses squabbling over territory.While Mechwarrior 4 uses the basis of the split of the Federated Commonwealth, the ignore the lunacy of lost technology and the inability to build new mechs. Instead, Melissa Steiner has ordered the execution of Duke Dressari of Kentares IV, and in a stunning opening cinematic which uses real actors and not CGI graphics, we see the 5th Donegal Regiment lay waste to the defending forces. The only survivor, of course, is your character, young Ian Dressari who was off world at the time who comes home to reclaim his birthright and to force Steiner's puppet dictator off the planet. Ian is joined by a motley crew of freedom fighters-from engineers to mechwarriors who aid him in his quest.The single planet campaign is handled far better in Vengeance than Mechwarrior 3, because it really gives a sense of advancement as your loyalist forces move across the planet from region to region liberating key areas and securing resources. As time progresses you gain additional pilots with which to form a decent lance, weapons, and more battlemechs. Mech design is also superior over Mechwarrior 3, the 3D artists obviously taking their time to provide the best designs Battletech has to offer, (let's face it, many of the mechs in the Technical Readout volumes have been less than inspired.) Units themselves run the gamut from light recon all the way up 100-ton heavy and assault mechs, including some of my favorites like the Mad Cat (Timber Wolf), Nova Cat, and the Daishi. Once I got the Mad Cat, I pretty much stayed with it for the duration of the campaign.Missions are fun and varied, ranging from straight out mech melees, capturing supply caravans, even defending a coastal village from an sea strike from naval vessels. Even grudge matches from villains that you meet via intercepted communications, including your evil cousin who you must face in the last mission in a fight to death. And by the end of the campaign you have over 20 mechs to play with and hundreds of weapons, including some weird creations that I have never heard of before, like 40-racks of medium range missiles, light gauss cannons and something called a bombast laser. Where I think it falls apart slightly is when you outfit your mechs.In standard Battletech, any critical location big enough to hold a weapon can hold any weapon, not so in Vengeance. Instead, locations are assigned color codes and spaces. Red for Energy weapons, Green for Missiles, and Yellow for Ballistic weapons like machine guns and auto-cannons. Plus Grey for Clan Omni-mechs, which can hold any type of armament. Additionally, their method for grouping weapons is a little arbitrary, and unless you have an advance joystick means you'll be fingering repeatedly for the keyboard to fire other than your primary weapons groups. Also, recycle times on weapons is perhaps a little too long 5 seconds before you can re-fire a PPC, up to 6 or 7 seconds for auto-cannons, which plays up the importance of adding secondary and tertiary fire capabilities to your mech. I completed the game with a 90 ton Daishi with twin Clan LBX-AC20s and a triple punch of Clan LRM-15s. This 1-2 punch combination meant I was smoking heavies and assaults in 2-4 shots. And because they're very heat efficient weapons, I could drop the number of heat sinks to increase armor and engine power.3D graphics are a mix bag. A lot of terrain bit maps are quite good, but trees look like cardboard cut outs, seams can be seen where they laid down their textures for the ground, and lighting effects are so-so. The mechs themselves are beautiful, have gorgeous movement that convey an awesome sense of power and weight. Shadow effects of your mech seemed to be an afterthought-looking more like a dark "T" on the ground. Your mech's search lights are next to useless, shining `under' water terrain, but not across it, not that they help you see any better in night missions. The light amplification function also seems like an afterthought, turning your field of vision into an eye-splitting green, so save yourself a ton of equipment and avoid it. Mech explosions, missile con trails and weapons fire are first-rate. But don't get into the trap I fell into-stay away from exploding mechs, the backwash is a pain.All in all a solid effort from the folks at Microsoft and Fasa Corp. The solid game play backed up by a good story, firt rate cut scenes all combine into a wonderful Battletech experience. The full motion video cut scenes and briefings, plus interplay between you and your lance-mates only add to its success as a video game. If you like Battletech and have at least enjoyed Mechwarrior 2, then give this a try, you won't be disappointed.
Once again the Mechwarrior torch has been passed on, once in the hands of Activision for three games-Mechwarrior 2, then Ghost Bear Legacy and finally Mercenaries, it was handed off to Microprose who bumbled Mechwarrior 3 on a rather grand scale. Now that Fasa has swallowed by Microsoft as yet another franchise under their banner. That said, "Mechwarrior 4: Vengeance" is a worthy successor to Mechwarrior 2, and pigeon holes into the overall Battletech story line perfectly. Though that story line is degenerating thanks to bad writing in the form of Battletech novels and RPG source material in the Federated Commonwealth of House Steiner and House Davion has been shattered, pretty much guaranteeing that everything will return to the same old boring status quo of five Successor Houses squabbling over territory.While Mechwarrior 4 uses the basis of the split of the Federated Commonwealth, the ignore the lunacy of lost technology and the inability to build new mechs. Instead, Melissa Steiner has ordered the execution of Duke Dressari of Kentares IV, and in a stunning opening cinematic which uses real actors and not CGI graphics, we see the 5th Donegal Regiment lay waste to the defending forces. The only survivor, of course, is your character, young Ian Dressari who was off world at the time who comes home to reclaim his birthright and to force Steiner's puppet dictator off the planet. Ian is joined by a motley crew of freedom fighters-from engineers to mechwarriors who aid him in his quest.The single planet campaign is handled far better in Vengeance than Mechwarrior 3, because it really gives a sense of advancement as your loyalist forces move across the planet from region to region liberating key areas and securing resources. As time progresses you gain additional pilots with which to form a decent lance, weapons, and more battlemechs. Mech design is also superior over Mechwarrior 3, the 3D artists obviously taking their time to provide the best designs Battletech has to offer, (let's face it, many of the mechs in the Technical Readout volumes have been less than inspired.) Units themselves run the gamut from light recon all the way up 100-ton heavy and assault mechs, including some of my favorites like the Mad Cat (Timber Wolf), Nova Cat, and the Daishi. Once I got the Mad Cat, I pretty much stayed with it for the duration of the campaign.Missions are fun and varied, ranging from straight out mech melees, capturing supply caravans, even defending a coastal village from an sea strike from naval vessels.

I had trouble getting this one to run, but finally was successful.  I am running an AMD/K6-2 (350) CPU, with 64 Mb of RAM, and a Diamond Monster 3D II accelerator, with a Flightstick Pro and rudder pedals.  According to the package, I meet all of the requirements.  My operating system is Microsoft's Windows ME.I loaded CFS2 twice, but when I tried to play it could not get past loading the scenery, when my screen went black.  The machine locked up!  Finally after trying the new drivers for the Diamond Monster, which I found on their European site, I got it to run properly.You would think, though, that Microsoft, with all of their expertise, could design a game that would run without so many hassles.The game is good.  Graphics are superb, sound is good, and the scenery is excellent.  The game runs smoothly, when you finally get it to run.  I found some fault, of course.First, I dislike the annoying cones that point you at the nearby enemy.  They are certainly not realistic.  Also, the enemy planes flit about in a most unrealistic fashion, and make them unrealistically hard to track.  Even closing at a combined speed of 600 miles an hour, another aircraft should be more easily followed.  However, Microsoft is no guiltier than many other simulation designers in such matters.Modeling of the aircrafts' flight characteristics is not bad, but not entirely realistic, either.  I took an F6F &quot;Hellcat&quot; up to 10,000 feet above Kwajalein atoll, an airstrip from which I have flown, and put her into a spin.  This is an aircraft that was relatively easy to fly (I soloed in 1946 in the real thing.)  Although I kicked reverse rudder and neutralized the controls properly, she would not recover from the spin and go into a dive.  The F6F was not notorious for having bad spin characteristics.Also, dropping your landing gear at a couple hundred miles an hour should not result in &quot;gear damage.&quot;  Pilots often did it in combat, to get a sudden reduction in speed.Another problem is the slow reaction of the machine guns to the gun button.  And after the button is released, they inexplicably keep on firing for a couple or three seconds.The copy writers who wrote the Pilot's Manual fell into the same trap as everyone else in comparing the F6F with the F4U &quot;Corsair.&quot;  They claimed that the F6F is &quot;far from the fastest U.S. fighter&quot; but that it was in the &quot;top rank of American fighters in the Pacific theater, along with the Vought Corsair.&quot;  They claim a top speed for the Hellcat of 327 knots (376 mph) at 17,300 feet, while the Corsair is credited with a top speed of 363 knots (417 mph) at 19,900 feet, making the Corsair seem much faster.  One gets tired of hearing such unfair comparisons.I've got news for them: an article in Flight Journal last year by Corky Meyer (a Grumman test pilot) described a side by side test of the Corsair and Hellcat, flat out at the same altitude (they had the same R2800, 2,000 horsepower Pratt &amp; Whitney engine, but different dash numbers) had them performing at the same speed over the ground, but the Corsair was indicating a higher speed due to the different placement of the pitot tube.Because of its wing design, the Corsair had a quicker roll characteristic than the Hellcat.  It was also more unstable and difficult to fly, and taxiing and landing visibility was hampered by the long engine nacelle.  They called it the &quot;Ensign Eliminator.&quot;  Otherwise, they were very evenly matched in their performance characteristics.The copy writers call the Corsair &quot;big, tough, and fast,&quot; which it was of course, but the F6F pilots shot down over 70 percent of all air-to-air kills in the Pacific war.  It is a vastly under rated airplane, by the desk jockeys.Here are some figures:  The Hellcat is credited with 5,156 air victories during WWII, and 306 Hellcat pilots shot down 5 or more enemy planes (the definition of an &quot;ace.&quot;)  Corsairs shot down 2,140 enemy, and made only 93 aces, although they enbtered service in the Pacific first.  The famed Mustang was credited with only 296 kills, and made only 5 aces.  The little F4F &quot;Wildcat,&quot; with 1,006 kills made 58 aces, and was bad-mouthed as being obsolete at the war's beginning.  Looking only at results, one wonders at the critics remarks.But, this is a fine game.  The graphics are right up there with Jane's WWII Fighters, and it will be a source of much pleasure for a lot of people.Joseph Pierre, USN (Ret)

I have been waiting for Halo 3 since the day Halo 2 came out. I have listened to every Bungie Podcast, and read every Bungie weekly update. That being said, my hype for this game was way higher than that of the average user. Based on what I'd seen in the beta and read/heard from Bungie, I knew the game was going to rock. I just didn't know how much it was going to rock. I will say it right now: Halo 3 is the best game that I've ever played on any console or computer. Period. And I've played a LOT of games. From the epic story to the amazingly in depth multiplayer, the game delivers extremely well on all fronts. I have no doubt that every gamer (or even somebody who's not a huge gamer) will love Halo 3. Due to the complexity of the game, this review consists of two main sections (Multiplayer and Campaign), each of which is broken down into subdivisions.Campaign--Story: 10/10--If you've played other Halo games, then you basically know what the story in Halo 3 will be like. I can't really say too much about the story without spoiling anything, however the story starts out strong right where Halo 2 left off, and goes on strong. Bungie learned from their mistakes from Halo 2, and the story takes place only on Earth. The game does use an excessive amount of cut scenes, however they use the same engine as the game, so it never really feels like you are out of the game at all. Note: Be sure that you stick around to watch the credits, because there is more to come afterwards :)--Graphics: 9/10--The graphics in Halo 3's campaign are some of the best graphics I've ever seen on the 360. When you consider the fact that you can play 2-player co-op on one system with the same graphics and framerate, it is really amazing. The lighting and particle effects in the game are probably the best on any console game I've ever seen. Overall, the graphics are probably slightly worse than Gears of War or BioShock, but again, considering what this game does, the graphics are absolutely amazing. Loading takes place only in between levels, but the loading screen looks so amazing, you will probably wish you saw it more often.--Sound: 7/10--If you've watched the E3 2006 trailer for Halo 3, you've heard the music in Halo 3. Yes, the music is amazing, but Bungie chose to repeat the same song over and over and over again. The song always manages to fit what's going on the screen, but with Bungie's large budget, I'd have thought they could do better. As for the game's sound effects, they are absolutely amazing. Each gun has its own set of sounds, and they sound differently when they are far away or in a small area. The characters make some hilarious noises when they die, and the voice acting in the game can't be beat. Bungie has gone to great efforts to ensure that the voice acting is interesting, and they have really succeeded. Other than the poor variety of music the sound in Halo 3 is absolutely amazing.--Gameplay: 10/10--Gameplay is where Halo 3 shines the most. The controls have been perfected for the Xbox 360 controller. They may take some time to get used to, however once you do, you will see that the changes are amazing. Of course, if you refuse to change, Bungie does offer a Halo 2 control scheme option that you can choose. Some have complained that Halo 3 is too much like Halo 2, but that couldn't be further from the truth. There is such a large variety of new weapons, and characters that it feels like you are playing a completely brand new game, not a copy of Halo 2 like some have claimed.--Online Co-op Play: 10/10--It was only a few weeks before release that Bungie finally announced what everybody had been waiting to hear: 4 player campaign cooperative play over Xbox Live. Why did Bungie wait so long to reveal this feature? They needed to be sure it worked perfectly before they promised it to gamers. Let me tell you, thanks to co-op play with meta scoring (gives you a score based on your in-game performance), the Halo 3 campaign is going to be replayed, and replayed, and replayed over and over again for tons of years to come. To start a co-op game you simple choose campaign from the main menu, and then invite your friends. You can play with 3 people online, or you and a guest can play with 2 others online. Either way, you are ensured a great experience. During my play with co-op, it has worked much better than I expected, and only lagged when I was playing with a friend who had a bad DSL internet connection. I should tell you right now that you need to play co-op on legendary difficulty, because as you might expect, the game gets substantially easier when there are 4 people fighting. Also, the only time you revert to the previous checkpoint is if all 4 of you die at once.Campaign score: 9.2/10 (an average of the above scores)Multiplayer9.2 is an amazing score for the campaign. But you haven't even scratched the surface of the game yet until you've heard about multiplayer. For the past 3 years, Halo 2 has remained the most played Xbox Live game. Nothing could beat it. Except Halo 3, of course. I am amazed at all of the features included in Halo 3, and I'm always finding new stuff every time I play. The Multiplayer will be played for tens of years to come. That's just how great it is. Now, lets dive right in and try to take a look at all of the multiplayer features:--Graphics: 9/10--For obvious reasons, the graphics aren't as good in multiplayer as they are in campaign. That being said, the graphics are still flippin' amazing. I have no clue how Bungie has pulled off these amazing graphics with up to 4 players split-screen with no framerate hitches at all. Every time I play Halo 3 online, I catch myself stopped in the middle of the action staring at the detail in the environments. No two explosions are alike, and you will continue to be amazed at the level of detail in the graphics for a long, long time. My absolute favorite graphical feature is the water. I have died countless times while staring at the water. At first glance, the water looks great. Its flowing realistically, with waves and sloshes, and all that stuff. Then you see somebody jump in the water. There is a realistic splash, followed by realistic ripples around the person. My favorite thing to do is to stand in the water, and just watch how it ripples around me. The water effects are seriously that great. And so are the explosion effects, the wind effects, the lighting effects, and the particle effects. Combine all these amazing graphical effects, with the option to watch everything over again in slow motion (more on saved replay's later), and you have what is probably the most visually stunning multiplayer game ever.--Sound: 10/10--We have already covered how great the sound effects were in the Campaign, but multiplayer is even better. Shoot in the water for a realistic sound, shoot a wall for a realistic sound, kill a person for a realistic sound (or yelp in some cases- you will see what I mean when you are playing). The sound in Halo 3 multiplayer is unbeatable. Period. It's really hard to describe sound, so the most effective thing I can say is: Go get the game and play it for yourself to see how sweet it is.-- Multiplayer maps/game types/game play: 10/10 --The multiplayer maps included in Halo 3 are the strongest maps to date. I've played over 1000 multiplayer games, and have yet to find a map that I dislike. They are varied in size and shape. This time around, Bungie has really strayed away from the symmetrical maps to more asymmetrical maps. The change is really nice, and you will definitely appreciate it for games such as capture the flag, as it provides more of a fun experience. As for game types, all game types from Halo 2 make a return, as well as some of the popular ones from custom games such as "zombies" (renamed infection). All of the games and maps seem to be balanced perfectly, and it is never too difficult to complete an objective thanks to this great balance. And of course, even in the rare instance that you get a game type that you don't like in matchmaking, you can simply press X to veto it, and if more than 50% of the players in the game agree, a new map and game type will be chosen. The game play is similar to that of Halo 2, although the old weapons have been balanced (the energy sword still owns, but now it owns in a fair way), and the addition of equipment really has a fun effect on the game. Equipment items include a bubble shield, a portable gravity lift, a trip mine, a power drainer, or power regenerator, just to name a few. These can be activated by pressing the X button, and are thrown sort of like grenades. They last for about 30 seconds or until somebody blows it up. Overall, the multiplayer experience is the best in any game, ever, and won't be beat until Bungie releases their next title.--Online rankings/other extra features: 10/10--The amount of extra features included in Halo 3 is absolutely astounding. First, you have saved replay's, which let you save a replay of any multiplayer (or campaign) game and watch it back from any angle, frame-by-frame. You may or may not think it sounds cool, but once you try it out, you will wonder how you survived Halo 2 without it. It makes your smack talk so much more powerful, and you can now prove to your friends that you "got a 100 kill spree last night." (or they can prove that you didn't). Of course, once you have your film, you naturally want to share it, so Bungie lets you upload up to 6 files to their server for storage and sharing with other members. Another great extra included in Halo 3 is Forge. Forge is a basic map editor. It lets you move spawn points, weapons, scenery, etc. You can edit basically anything other than the physical layout of the map. And after you get the perfect map, you can save it and upload to your file share for all to enjoy. It really is extremely amazing, you just have to see it to believe it.--Lasting Appeal 11/10--When you consider everything that I've mentioned in both the campaign and multiplayer aspects, its really amazing. You could spend an entire day exploring the features I've mentioned in this review, and still not have seen everything. Halo 2 never lost its popularity (even after the release of Halo 3, there are an average of 40,000 people playing Halo 2 online every day), and with all the exciting new features in Halo 3, it is going to retain its popularity for even longer. I know people are going to be mad that I gave lasting appeal an 11/10, but I firmly believe that by the time Bungie's "next project" is released, Halo 3 will still be my most played game.Multiplayer Rating 5/5 (an average of the above scores)Final Score and ThoughtsI've said it before, and I'll say it again: Halo 3 is THE BEST GAME I'VE EVER PLAYED. I don't know how Bungie got this much game made in 3 years, but it is simply amazing. Everybody should purchase this game- you won't regret it. As a final sum-up I will offer some pro's and con's.Pro's:Amazing graphicsAmazing AIGreat soundBest Multiplayer aroundCon's:Could use a better variety of musicRewinding saved films is a bit awkward- you will see what I mean when you try.A matchmaking feature for custom games promised by Bungie has gone strangely missing :(Overall Score: 5/5- PERFECT (overall impression, not an average of the above)
Halo Man's back in action! Er... Master Chief's back in action. I can't say I'm the biggest Halo fan. I generally like the series but definitely felt it was going in the wrong direction since Halo 3 and ODS or whatever that other one was called. Halo Reach did bring me back to respect the series again with a good story acting as a prequel and a farewell from Bungie. When it was announced that there was going to be a Halo 4 my first thought was `...really? I thought Master Chief died.' I only found out about the true ending to Halo 3 last year...  Yeah, I didn't really care to play through the game on legendary. So my very first impressions for Halo 4 weren't too good and it has really stayed off my radar till this week and sometimes it's best to not have your hopes up for a pleasant surprise. Maybe it's because AC3 was such a disappointment but I really liked Halo 4. It's also been awhile since I've played a shooter. I stopped playing them for awhile because I had grown tired of them (THANKS CoD...). I have to say this is the best Halo game I've played since Halo 2 back in 2004. It has some miss steps in game play and story but seems to be a promising start to a new chapter in the Halo series.STORY: The game starts aboard the wreckage of the UNSC starship Forward Unto Dawn, four years after the events of Halo 3. The holographic vixen AI that is Cortana wakes up Master Chief from his long cryogenically induced sleep as the remains of the ship they are on is being attacked by Covenant forces. They discover that they have drifted near the mysterious Forerunner planet Requiem. During the battle, the planet activates a gravity well and sucks them into it. On the surface they encounter the Covenant who are searching for something and they also encounter cybernetic beings known as Prometheans. As they explore and battle through this bizarre planet, they discover a being called The Didact that was imprisoned here and inadvertently release him. He, of course, wants to kill all humans and take over the universe. In the midst of all this, Cortana reveals to Master Chief, who has been with him since the beginning of the series, that she is going rampant, a condition that happens to AI's over 7 years old and ultimately results being shut down aka death. And this plot point is the strongest part of the story. The interesting relationship between Master Chief and Cortana gets really looked at and developed here or more so than in the previous games. You know that the fate of Cortana can't end well and it weighs in on the heart strings throughout the game. It also shows that Cortana, a computer AI seems to be more human than Master Chief, a human. Not an ordinary human, but human none the less.The campaign finishes up around 10 hours, which is sadly rather long for an FPS game these days. The story is presented well and has a good pace. It kind of sags in the middle which is not helped by game play that gets a little repetitive by that time but it does pick up again. It is a bit predictable, especially if you've played other Halo games. Outside of Master Chief and Cortana, other characters are not really explored. They are just mainly there to move the plot along. There are some new Spartans including a female Spartan who is there, says a couple lines then is gone. I think she is supposed to be from the expanded universe but I'm not sure. Speaking of expanded universe, I think there are a lot of references to the Halo books in this game but, me having not read them, did not pick up on them. Like I said, the best part of the story is the relationship between Chief and Cortana and even that I wish was developed a little more. The story and game doesn't do much to take any risks outside the usual fair that the series puts on. I will say it does have a bitter sweet ending and I am curious to see what comes of this new chapter in the Halo series.GAMEPLAY: For those who are familiar to the Halo series, there are no big surprises to the controls and plays like pretty much all the games before it. Heh, though some hardcore Halo fans are mighty pissed at some new additions because it's too much like Call of Duty. I don't know what they're going on about because the only thing I can see that was added was a sprint button which is great. I would have liked to see the ability to aim down the sights with all the weapons besides the ones with optics but then again, some of the weapons in Halo don't even have sights. I don't know how anyone is supposed to actually aim with the assault rifle but anyway. There are a lot of weapons we know from previous games that return a long with all new weapons use by the Prometheans. The coolest thing about these guns is how they look and act. They disassemble and reassemble on their own when you pick them up and reload. The first time you see it, you'll be like WOAH THAT'S AWESOME! Some of the weapons feel a bit under powered but that's mainly the assault rifle type weapons, the other guns feel just right. A really cool new weapon that was added is called the sticky launcher and is fun to use. It shoots a little sticky explosive that you can remote detonate. It's great for killing large groups of enemies.The new HUD is neat looking with the corners of Master Chief's visor visible in the corners of the screen so it feels more like it's from his POV, kind of like Samus in the Metriod Prime games. It does, however, make the screen a little cluttered, especially when holding a big weapon. Makes me feel kind of claustrophobic, I don't know. Now one thing that has always bothered me about Halo is that, Master Chief, this guy with super power armor, doesn't really feel all that powerful outside of a regenerating shield and being able to jump like he's on the moon. Now I never gave this all that much thought until I played Crysis 2. Crysis is the way to do an FPS with a character with power armor. In Crysis, your character has invisibility, hard armor mode, increased speed, jumping, and strength that are all regulated by a power meter in your HUD. You don't need any items to do any of this, it's up to you to manage these powers with the energy meter and it adds a dynamic that lets you play the game however you want. I was hoping there would be more things like that in Halo 4. My wish was half granted in the form of power ups that you can swap out. Things like hard energy shields, cloaking, thermal vision, portable sentry bots, come in the form of these powers that you can find and swap out. These are kind of like the shield items from Halo 3 but instead of being one time use, they recharge when they are not being used. They're not bad but sometimes it's hard to really know which one would be more useful to you as you progress through certain areas and most of the time it doesn't exactly matter.The game play tries to stay exciting and varied with some fun vehicle levels and flying type space shooter levels that return from Halo Reach, though I feel the space combat level from Reach was better. There are some levels near the middle of the game where some of the repetitiveness from some of the older games shows through, ie run and gun from way point to way point. It would have been nice to see Halo try and step out of its safe zone more than it has. That's the problem a lot of these mega franchises have; they are afraid to step out of their comfort zone in fear of upsetting and losing their fans and the majority of their fans pretty much ask for the same thing over and over again, be it they realize it or not. I'm looking at you Call of Duty. Speaking of which, there is this multiplayer part. Totally not the reason I bought the game but I know it is the reason millions of fans did buy the game. Now, I have no way to play it online at this time so I know I'm missing out on the meat of the game that the fans really care about and if you want me to invite me to your house to play online or whatever, I'd be down with that. I do miss the old Halo parties I used to go in the mid-2000s. But we didn't need the internet; we just needed a bunch of tvs and networking hubs. Anyway, from what I've seen, the actual game play in multiplayer looks pretty much like it has been since Halo 2. I know there is a new class system that is supposed to be a lot like how Call of Duty's multiplayer system which has a lot of fans up in arms since they want Halo to be nothing like CoD even though Halo's multiplayer success is what paved the way for the success of Call of Duty's multiplayer and becoming the money making machine it is today. Multiplayer is no big deal to me. I'm an old school gamer in the sense that multiplayer is that extra little thing you do after you beat the game and have some friends over. If there are any real changes in the multiplayer that I should be aware of, please let me know.GRAPHICS: So I've been kind of ragging on this game about the game play and such but I can proudly say this about Halo 4: This is one of the BEST looking games I have ever seen on the Xbox 360. This game is just beautiful. The environments are so lush, vibrantly colored, have amazing lighting and are heavily detailed. You have look, I mean, really look to find any slightly blurry textures or anything. The weapon effects and explosions all look awesome. The HUD and sights for the weapons are all nicely detailed and look great. The character models all look fantastic and use facial scanning animation technology which I love and add depth and feeling to the characters. Master Chief looks amazing and his armor is so finely detailed. Cortana looks hotter than ever. Yes, I think Cortana is the hottest hologram AI ever. The rendered cut scenes are so high quality I honestly thought I was watching something that was filmed live action at first. Best of all, there is absolutely no slow down or frame rate drop in the game. 343 Industries really knew how to use the 360's hardware and produced one of the best looking games for the system ever.SOUND: Just like the graphics, the sound design is something to marvel at. To the loud explosions and sounds of battle to the little clicks of reloading your weapon, everything sounds so crisp and clean. The musical score is beautiful and I even went and downloaded the soundtrack after playing the game. All the voice acting is well done and believable with the exception of Master Chief. This game is probably the most I've heard him talk and while he sounds great in his usual calm and cool voice, it's the few moments where he actually has to raise his voice and make an emotion that made me laugh. However, it's Jen Taylor performance, who voices Cortana, which really steals the show. The heavy emotional state that Cortana is going through is brought to life by Taylor and oddly makes her feel like the most human character in the game. Excellent sound for an excellent looking game.Overall, Halo 4 is a beautiful game that sadly has a few missed opportunities. If it had just found a way to expand the game play more, take some more risks, and enrich the story a little more, I'd say this would be THE game of the year but it misses the mark. This game is meant to start a new chapter in the series so I am curious to see where they go with it and hope they can do more to really expand it in the future. If you're a Halo fan, what I say probably isn't going to bother you because I know you've probably already beaten it and are spending hours playing online. If you absolutely hate Halo, this game isn't going to change your mind at all. If you're on the fence, I'd say it's definitely worth picking up in a couple months after the price goes down some.OVERALL: 7.5/10
Halo 2 is definetely my favorite game for the Xbox system currently. With amazing graphics, gameplay, sound, many weapons, vehicles and the best online play to ever hit the Xbox so far, halo 2 is is the most playable game ever created.Halo 2 has a basic story, its just that Master Chief has returned and is once again trying to stop the covenant from taking over earth and all of the other planets. Master Chief is also trying to deny a weapon of massive power and one that would have a great effect on the world!Even though this game has a simple story, the gameplay is unthinkable. I will break up my review into different categories listed below...Graphics: One of the best parts of Halo 2 is definetely the graphics. The background detail is superb, the texture is smooth and clear. The water is also very well done compared to halo 1, but still not as good as some games have done. The cutscenes are worth bragging about, for example, when i was watching a halo 2 cutscene and my cousin came into the room he told me to "change the channel," as he obviousely thought i was watching television which i thought was kind of funny. The animations of your character reloading, moving and shooting are truely amazing as well, (you switch off from being the covenant and master chief throughout campaign) as it seems like a real movie like a previousely mentioned. Master Chief looks much cooler then he did in Halo 1, as he has a redesigned suit and many more guns with much better graphics. Although it seems like i am saying that the graphics are amazing, i do think that they could have done just a tiny bit of a better job on them just so that it could be one of the best games in terms of graphics to every hit the Xbox Console, that would be great! But all in all, the graphics are wonderful, and definetely not an aspect of the game to complain about, unless you are picky, wait, lemme refrase that, too picky!Gameplay: There is one word, and only one word to describe the gameplay in this game. Fun! Thats it, this is arguably the best game on the xbox console, and there are many reasons to support that.First of all, you are able to sprint at twice the speed that you could in Halo 1. For those of you who play Halo 2 you probobly do not see a difference really in the sprinting aspect. I didn't either when i first played the game, but after i played a lot of halo 2, and then played halo 1, you could definetely see the difference between the two in terms of the speed that you can sprint, which is much better then the first.You are also able to highjack vehicles which gives the game a little "grand theft auto" them to it which is very fun to do. When your playing on Xbox Live, you get a medal each time you highjack a vehicle. (You get medals for each bonus thing you do such as highjacking, sniping, assasinating, etc.) Of course you could not do this in the previous halo 1 game so thats another difference between the two.Another better thing in this game then there was before in the previous one is that the A.I is much smarter. For example, they can sometimes form a "short time alliance" with another enemy and they can swarm at you, or the grunts can hide behind corners and wait for you to come. The elites are also much better at dodging your shots which makes it much harder to hit them. Also, if you want your allies to drive a vehicle they can which you couldn't do in the first halo game. The only problem is that sometimes they don't show that they're smart by slamming into walls and you have to switch seats repetitively before they'll get there "nack" back.But as a result of my gameplay review, it has changed a lot over the long and painful time that it took for the sequel to come out.New Weapons: There are many new weapons in halo to and i will list them underneath. They include...(Keep in mind that the ratings are intirely my opinion)BR55 Battle Rifle: 2x scope, burst shots, all in all its an ok weapon, not the best. Long range: 6/10, Medium range: 6/10, Close range: 6/10Covenant Carbine: Basically the Covenant form of the Battle Rifle except that its not burst, its just a one shot fire. Pretty good though, as it can fire much faster then the battle rifle. Long range: 7/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 8/10Particle Beam Rifle: Covenant form of Sniper rifle, except that if you shoot two shots in a row it has to charge back up which takes a couple seconds, but i think its better then the sniper rifle seeing that if you have a good aim, you can finish your enemy off quickly! (Or ally, ha ha!) Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 6/10. The reason why the ratings decrease is because the closer you are to your enemy, the harder it becomes to shoot considering that your aimer is unbearably small, so its hard to aim, even from a far distance, but it doesn't take that much skill to be able to snipe people from afar.Brute Shot: In my opinion i hate this weapon. Only the brutes use it (in single player) and they can never kill me with it because it sucks. Its almost impossible to aim at anything moving from afar or even medium range. The only good thing is that the shots can bounce of walls, wooooopy! Long range: 1/10, Medium range: 3/10, Close range: 5/10Covenant Energy Sword: Probobly the best weapon for close range is the sword. Even from medium range you can lock on to your target and unleash a super upercut attack which is a one hit kill unless your openent uses a cheap overshield, which i personally think they should take out of the game, seeing that whoever has the overshield cannot be stopped by one person unless the openent has a sword or a rocket launcher. Long range: 0/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 10/10Fuel Rod Gun: Ahhhh, i wish this gun was in multiplayer but i guess it would be way to cheap, considering the amount of ammo it has and that it is a one hit kill. But for single player it works mighty fine! Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 10/10, Close range: 10/10Two other things i have to add is that you can dual weild certain weapons, but the only problem with this is that you cannot chuck grenades when you are dual weilding which kind of makes sense when you think about it. Also, the rocket launchers can lock on to vehicles which makes it much easier to destroy those cheap @$$ vehicle lovers!Vehicles: I will now mention the new vehicles in Halo 2. They are...M12G1 Warthog LAAV- Basically the same as the previous Warthog, except it uses a Gauss Cannon which is a one hit kill instead of the machine gun. (The previous Warthog is in Halo 2 as well.)9/10Specter: Sort of like the Wraith, (Wraiths can be used in multiplayer now) except its faster and can hold three people, one for the plasma cannot turret at the back, one in the side seat, and one obviousely driving the vehicle. 9/10Shadow: The vehicle that the covenant use, can hold up to 8 combatents depending on the species of convenant, an ok vehicle when your using it. It uses a plasma cannon like the rest of the other covenant vehicles. 7/10Two more things i have to add about the vehicles are that the Banshee can now be used in multiplayer as well as the Wraith which makes multipayer much more fun.Sound: A great game needs great audio right? Well halo 2 listened. From the classic halo chant, to the rather heavy halo 2 beat, comes wonderful sound and definetely good enough quality that you can just sit their drinking tea/coffee and listening to it. Well, i guess if your that obsessed with the audio, you can just by the soundrack right?Online: Now comes the best part. The online multiplayer play. I have to say, i though crimson skies had the best online multiplayer play, but as soon as this hit came out i quickly regreted myself saying that. Basically, there are ranked games and unranked games, (unranked games are known as training games.) As you win ranked games you gain levels, you start out at level 1 and the last level is level 50, but i believe that the highest level right now is 27, so as you can see its extremely hard to work your way up once you get past level 20.The different ranked games are as follows...Rumble Pit: Up to 8 players all dualing it out against each other. Thit matchmake playlist can include normal slayer, all rockets, all swords, all shotguns, odball, or king of the hill. This is probobly my favorite kind of playlist to play.Team Skirmish: Up to 8 players, 4 on 4, on a team obviousely. This playlist usually includes the different types of Capture the Flag, team odball, 3 plots or assault. Pretty fun playlist to play!Team Slayer: 8 players, 4 on 4 against each other can include normal team slayer, team rockets, team swords, Fiesta Team slayer, team shotguns or team phantoms. Probobly runner up for my favorite playist to play halo 2 on.Head to Head: Simple straight up slayer games 1 v 1 can inlcude normal slayer, all swords or all rifles. Very fun, and addicting especially when your winning.Big team battle: Huge game, up to 16 players, 8 v 8 can include team slayer, different types of CTF, Assault, or land grab where you have to take over different areas of land. Very fun playlist as it sounds like, but can get very hard and boring considering that your dying a whole tun, especially when your playing on a smaller map.Clan Battles: Basically, you can join a clan which in different words is like a club and you get your clan together and battle with them in different match types. Pretty fun, good for bragging rights. When your clan starts winning, it will level up.In conclusion to my online review and whole halo 2 review, the online aspect is probobly the best part of this entire game. Its so much fun trash talking to your opponents and so addicting to play ranked games. You can also just play custom games where you can invite all your friends to play whatever type/map you want. You can also customize ever thinkable option which makes this game truely worth your time and money.Halo 2 delivers excellent gameplayer/graphics/sound/online play which definetely makes the game a worthy $50. Halo 2 is definetely not one of those games that you are going to end up returning straight away after you get it, you'll be twice as addicted to it as you were to Halo 1! (Unless you don't have Xbox, and if you don't like halo, no offence, but theres something wrong with you.)COLLECTORS EDITION:With collectors edition, you get a ton of new features which includes a cooler looking game case, a "behind the scenes" footage of halo 2 and how this amazing game was made. It also includes Visualizing the story (Concept Art, Early Level Design From Script to Game, Narrated Storyboards and Character Tests. Also, the collectors edition includes bonus materials which has features such as trailers from halo 1 and 2, Cut scenes, commentaries, Inside Bungie, A bungie history, before halo, the making of halo 1 and Gameographies.GET THE COLLECTORS EDITION, IT IS WORTH YOUR MONEY!

The only problem is that sometimes they don't show that they're smart by slamming into walls and you have to switch seats repetitively before they'll get there "nack" back.But as a result of my gameplay review, it has changed a lot over the long and painful time that it took for the sequel to come out.New Weapons: There are many new weapons in halo to and i will list them underneath. They include...(Keep in mind that the ratings are intirely my opinion)BR55 Battle Rifle: 2x scope, burst shots, all in all its an ok weapon, not the best. Long range: 6/10, Medium range: 6/10, Close range: 6/10Covenant Carbine: Basically the Covenant form of the Battle Rifle except that its not burst, its just a one shot fire. Pretty good though, as it can fire much faster then the battle rifle. Long range: 7/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 8/10Particle Beam Rifle: Covenant form of Sniper rifle, except that if you shoot two shots in a row it has to charge back up which takes a couple seconds, but i think its better then the sniper rifle seeing that if you have a good aim, you can finish your enemy off quickly! (Or ally, ha ha!) Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 6/10. The reason why the ratings decrease is because the closer you are to your enemy, the harder it becomes to shoot considering that your aimer is unbearably small, so its hard to aim, even from a far distance, but it doesn't take that much skill to be able to snipe people from afar.Brute Shot: In my opinion i hate this weapon. Only the brutes use it (in single player) and they can never kill me with it because it sucks. Its almost impossible to aim at anything moving from afar or even medium range. The only good thing is that the shots can bounce of walls, wooooopy! Long range: 1/10, Medium range: 3/10, Close range: 5/10Covenant Energy Sword: Probobly the best weapon for close range is the sword. Even from medium range you can lock on to your target and unleash a super upercut attack which is a one hit kill unless your openent uses a cheap overshield, which i personally think they should take out of the game, seeing that whoever has the overshield cannot be stopped by one person unless the openent has a sword or a rocket launcher. Long range: 0/10, Medium range: 8/10, Close range: 10/10Fuel Rod Gun: Ahhhh, i wish this gun was in multiplayer but i guess it would be way to cheap, considering the amount of ammo it has and that it is a one hit kill. But for single player it works mighty fine! Long range: 10/10, Medium range: 10/10, Close range: 10/10Two other things i have to add is that you can dual weild certain weapons, but the only problem with this is that you cannot chuck grenades when you are dual weilding which kind of makes sense when you think about it. Also, the rocket launchers can lock on to vehicles which makes it much easier to destroy those cheap @$$ vehicle lovers!Vehicles: I will now mention the new vehicles in Halo 2. They are...M12G1 Warthog LAAV- Basically the same as the previous Warthog, except it uses a Gauss Cannon which is a one hit kill instead of the machine gun. (The previous Warthog is in Halo 2 as well.)9/10Specter: Sort of like the Wraith, (Wraiths can be used in multiplayer now) except its faster and can hold three people, one for the plasma cannot turret at the back, one in the side seat, and one obviousely driving the vehicle. 9/10Shadow: The vehicle that the covenant use, can hold up to 8 combatents depending on the species of convenant, an ok vehicle when your using it. It uses a plasma cannon like the rest of the other covenant vehicles. 7/10Two more things i have to add about the vehicles are that the Banshee can now be used in multiplayer as well as the Wraith which makes multipayer much more fun.Sound: A great game needs great audio right? Well halo 2 listened. From the classic halo chant, to the rather heavy halo 2 beat, comes wonderful sound and definetely good enough quality that you can just sit their drinking tea/coffee and listening to it. Well, i guess if your that obsessed with the audio, you can just by the soundrack right?Online: Now comes the best part. The online multiplayer play. I have to say, i though crimson skies had the best online multiplayer play, but as soon as this hit came out i quickly regreted myself saying that. Basically, there are ranked games and unranked games, (unranked games are known as training games.) As you win ranked games you gain levels, you start out at level 1 and the last level is level 50, but i believe that the highest level right now is 27, so as you can see its extremely hard to work your way up once you get past level 20.The different ranked games are as follows...Rumble Pit: Up to 8 players all dualing it out against each other. Thit matchmake playlist can include normal slayer, all rockets, all swords, all shotguns, odball, or king of the hill. This is probobly my favorite kind of playlist to play.Team Skirmish: Up to 8 players, 4 on 4, on a team obviousely. This playlist usually includes the different types of Capture the Flag, team odball, 3 plots or assault. Pretty fun playlist to play!Team Slayer: 8 players, 4 on 4 against each other can include normal team slayer, team rockets, team swords, Fiesta Team slayer, team shotguns or team phantoms. Probobly runner up for my favorite playist to play halo 2 on.Head to Head: Simple straight up slayer games 1 v 1 can inlcude normal slayer, all swords or all rifles. Very fun, and addicting especially when your winning.Big team battle: Huge game, up to 16 players, 8 v 8 can include team slayer, different types of CTF, Assault, or land grab where you have to take over different areas of land. Very fun playlist as it sounds like, but can get very hard and boring considering that your dying a whole tun, especially when your playing on a smaller map.Clan Battles: Basically, you can join a clan which in different words is like a club and you get your clan together and battle with them in different match types. Pretty fun, good for bragging rights. When your clan starts winning, it will level up.In conclusion to my online review and whole halo 2 review, the online aspect is probobly the best part of this entire game. Its so much fun trash talking to your opponents and so addicting to play ranked games. You can also just play custom games where you can invite all your friends to play whatever type/map you want. You can also customize ever thinkable option which makes this game truely worth your time and money.Halo 2 delivers excellent gameplayer/graphics/sound/online play which definetely makes the game a worthy $50. Halo 2 is definetely not one of those games that you are going to end up returning straight away after you get it, you'll be twice as addicted to it as you were to Halo 1! (Unless you don't have Xbox, and if you don't like halo, no offence, but theres something wrong with you.)
