What happens when you find yourself trapped in a world where animals can speak? Animal Crossing is that world. Animal Crossing offers some of the most innovative game play Nintendo has to offer, but was very poorly executed.Animal Crossing is a neat, little game where you enter a town run by animals. The animals CAN speak English. Believe it or not, Nintendo actually programmed the game to phonetically sound out everything being said. This means that if you close your eyes, you can still understand the dialog, even though it has been sped up to the speed of the Alvin, Simon, and Theodore. All the animals talk like this, with various tonal differences. Ivan the Russian bear speaks with a deep voice, while the Cat (I do not remember her name) speaks in a high pitched voice. This is called Animalese. Animalese is great because of the phonetic speech, but can become quickly annoying.  There is also a silent voice, where text just appears and an option where you get the standard beep tone every time a word appears on-screen. For the duration of my play, I left it on Animalese, to see if Nintendo kept the speech  consistent through the game. Believe it or not, they did.The game has an interesting beginning. Before you see your character, you are asked questions by a cat on a train. The cat will ask you your name, which becomes the name you will be addressed by through out the game. Then you are asked what you think of your name. By answering "It is a good name", the cat assumes you are a boy. Alternatively, by answering "It is a cute name", the cat thinks you are a girl. You then receive a chance to correct the cat if he guesses your gender incorrectly because of the option you chose. Once you exit the train, a Raccoon named Tom Nook will show you to a group of four houses. These houses are possible starting points for you. Once you select a house, the Raccoon tells you that you owe him for the house. At this point, you spend most of your time paying for the house, rather than having fun. Initially, you begin paying for your house by running errands for Nook. He then sets you free to find your own way of running errands. You must pay Nook at least 1000 bells (bells is the currency) a week. If you do not like being indebt, get used to it in this game.The real fun begins, once Tom Nook sets you loose. You have more time to explore the town. Nintendo had the foresight to employ the Game Cube's internal clock to have an effect on play. The game is in real time, and stuff changes even while you are not playing, though, you should not leave your Game Cube on all day and night. The townsfolk have their set schedules that they follow. Most of them stay near their houses in the night hours, but may walk the town during the day time. Even the post office changes clerks, depending on the time you are playing the game. You must also remember to not play the game too long. If you keep interacting with the townsfolk all day and all night, they will not get their much needed sleep and will tend to be very curt with you the next time you turn on your Game Cube. This can be very amusing, but upset neighbors can really impede your progress.The environments are well  portrayed. Overall, Nintendo kept a child-like feel to Animal Crossing. The graphics are simple and the environments are easy to navigate. The size of the town is rather small, so depending on your preference, this can either be a positive or a negative to the overall game. I am personally pleased with the ability to customize the inside of your house, though you spend so little time inside, that it becomes as useless as the room feature in Pok&eacute;mon G/S. My only issue with the towns is when you are running errands, sometimes, you need to run from one end, to the exact opposite end of the town. This not only takes time, but can get tedious.Animal Crossing supports the Gameboy Advance E-Reader. With the E-Reader, you can add furniture and other items to your inventory. This is a neat idea. Personally, I enjoy little antics and innovations like this, but in Animal Crossing, you can even swipe the E-Reader classic games and be able to play them on your Nintendo (if you buy one from Tom Nook). The E-Reader cards are an incurred cost (as you actually have to go out an buy them), but prove to be more like the Pok&eacute;mon Trading Card game, short lived.I found Animal Crossing to be a very repetitive game. You spend most of your time running errands and interacting with the townspeople. This tends to get very repetitive. If I wanted to work on my relationships with others, I would play The Sims  (PC and PS2) by Electronic Arts. As for the Gameboy Advance E-Reader interaction, I find this to be a more costly expense than it is worth. In all seriousness, who really wants to go out and spend more money on cards that they will only use for Animal Crossing, then throw away when they get rid of their Nintendo Game Cube? My largest complaint about Animal Crossing is that by the time I got a shovel, I could not use it the way I wanted. If I could have, the town's population would drop to 1, and there would be dirt mounds near each villager's house.Overall, Animal Crossing finds the same replay value as Harvest Moon. You either enjoy the repetition, or you hate it. Because of its simple nature, I can see Animal Crossing appealing to players under 12.  For more intelligent players or players who do not work in factories, I recommend staying away from this game. Needless to say, I did not like Animal Crossing.

I wonder how many of the 5-star reviews here were written by people who played this for an hour and decided they liked it.  I've been playing this for over a month and to be honest after the island and barber shop were locked, everything just became so mundane and ultimately boring.  I also have the not-so-uncommon luck of scoring a large percentage of ugly and rude NPC villagers. You can have only up to 10 animal villagers, the last of which can only be invited at the camp site after it's built. My villagers tend to be rude, calling me bad names and often criticizing me for being fat. I wonder if the dialogs were lost in translation. I'm shocked by the insensitivities of some of the things the animals say. They're especially bad for kids; my son refused to play it again after he was told he was annoying by one of the characters. Complaining to Isabelle, the yellow dog who ultimately runs the town, did not help.The game involves catching the same bugs and fish, in the town or on Tortimer's Island, and planting a few flowers and talking to aforementioned rude neighbors. You can visit other towns and use StreetPass to set up the home showcase park, but all these become boring after a few days.I now hope I can sell this game for a good price.
Maybe it's just me, but I'm seriously considering the possibility that Nintendo's Animal Crossing has millions of people brainwashed.  When I read such positive reviews about such an uninspiring game, I thought of the old horror flick Halloween III.  Get the picture?  If you don't, simply watch H_3, and you'll come to understand.Now about the game itself.  Animal Crossing was a marketing success, but a nightmare behind closed doors for those who felt definite disappointment in the overall release.  Of course the majority of those who own Animal Crossing may feel a bit different.  Those of us who were looking for something more, were surely left in the dark.  Animal Crossing COULD have been a GREAT game.  Instead, it was released with stone age graphics, very limited real life concepts and nothing to offer for the more mature gaming community.Not all of Animal Crossing is terrible.  The real time concept was unique and impressive.  Anything else brought into the same light would be considered a joke.  Many would like to put TheSims and Animal Crossing in the same boat, but the two really can't be compared.  TheSims has endless possibilities, while Animal Crossing is extremely limited.  Two stars are given for innovation and innovation alone.  Animal Crossing could have been a game of sheer genius.  Could_a-should_a-would_a - blah.

That means 59 blocks should be only $1.32415e-4 = $0.0001324Wow so Nintendo is actually making 755101% profit by charging at $1.00.

The memory card does it's job, but has limited space.  Some games require less than 15 blocks, and so several can fit on one card. It's nice to store a single card with each game disc, but that can become expensive, essentially adding 15.00 to each game title.In the case of Madden 2002, you use a full card if you want to save a season, plus you need additional blocks to save any settings or user information.  Simply, unless you want to re-enter information, you need 2 cards for Madden alone.It would be nice to see the cards drop to a more reasonable rate of around 5 bucks per 59 blocks of memory, and I wait anxiously for a card that holds mega-blocks of memory, or an adapter to utilize flash memory.I have only encountered one off brand gamecube memory card, and it only saves you about 3 dollars in cost, has no more memory, and doesn't fit into the storage case memory card holder because it is longer than the Nintendo branded card.

Guys are you serious? golden sun tla get 4.8/5 stars? Why everyone rated this mediocre game so high is beyond me.Positive- I like the puzzle-oriented dungeons and the Dijn system- some tunes are catchy- at least better story then golden sun 1Negative- worst sound effect ever, really disturb me, the noise of a drill is a lot better to my  ears- graphic in the word map is laughable, the most deformed pile of pixel ever seen, the other in game graphics are no good either. battle graphic is pixellated almost as the word map. the exploration graphics are really overrated, repetitive and the color palette is too light.- story is very lacking, childish, generic, cliche and predictable.- characters are not interesting at all, a bunch of  stereotyped childs.- aside from the story, this game is 100% identical to golden sun 1- arghh the worst thing about golden sun, the atrocious script. I nerver seen most long, stupid and boring dialogues like these. seems like the script is writed by moron  childs... and for moron childs, the yes-no choices are totally useless and make the game dialogue even more stupid.graphic : 5/10music: 8/10story: 5/10characters: 5/10gameplay: 8/10sound effect: 0/10originality: -10/10dialogue: -1000000000000000/10

The graphics aren't the best with a tendency towards repetition, but the right effects and touches have been utilized to create varied environments, including staples like snow, desert, circus and jungle. Wario's animations are spot-on, and each of the weird enemies really captures the oddity of the world. I think the game would have really looked sharp if they opted for more of a claymation feel ?some of the creatures look halfway there already.The music plays up the action nicely and the sound effects are deliciously evil, with Wario singing nah-na-na-nah-nah during the paused screens, plus plenty of Wario outbursts left and right.Wario is a strangely endearing lug. It comes through in his goofy walk and his inexplicable self-confidence. I mean, here he is, ugly as sin, yet he still struts his stuff. Wario World is equally goofy and strange, but in an unassuming way, it's also good, unpretentious fun.

Kirby is one of the few title where you can say, with full confidence and sanity &quot;i just kicked a whole army's ass with a pink, puffy,.....thing!&quot; nightmare in dreamland is definately not the kirby for the ages. The game itself is classic kirby fun, witha few new added morphs. unfortunately, the storyline is sketchy and hard to follow, and the game is extremely short and easy. i personally put abot two of my gaming hours into this game, which is a meer drop compared tot he 37 hours i have saved to my final fantasy X file. Also, once you ahve run through the game, there really is no reason to do so a second time, because there are NO unlockables waht so ever. Don't get me wrong, the gmeplay of this game is still good fun, but if you have a super nintendo, you will find much more entertainment in kirby superstar.

I don't know why Nintendo made this game, especially considering most poeple would love to beat ol' Mike Tyson up now more than ever! It's essentially Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! without Mike Tyson -you fight some pasty blonde guy named Mister Dream instead. I guess Nintendo's contract ran out (or something) when Nintendo still wasn't ready to stop selling the game. Also, Great Tiger is now Glass Tiger. The controls are simple enough: A & B are punch buttons (holding Up while pressing either one results in a face-punch), Left and Right are for dodging, Down is for blocking (double-tap Down to duck), and Start is for a Super Punch provided you have at least one star. Unfortunately, you cannot pause the game so bathroom breaks must be taken between fights or rounds. As stated in my review of MTPO* (which Amazon.com may not have posted since I used a contraversial word), you play as Little Mac and your opponents are...* Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!In order of appearance: Glass Joe, a wuss who gives the French a bad name; Von Kaiser, a former boxing instructor from Germany; Piston Honda, an angry Japanese boxer; Don Flaminco, a flamboyant Spaniard who loves a woman named Carmen (San Diego perhapse?); King Hippo, a human tub of lard who wears size XXXL shorts and cannot get up once he is knocked down; Glass Tiger, an East-Indian with magic powers and a jewel (possibly The Eye of the Tiger) encrested into his turban; Bald Bull, an oddly familiar-looking fighter from Turkey; Soda Popinski, a soft-drink fanatic who loves soda and looks somewhat like Bald Bull except he's thinner and wears a speedo instead of shorts; Mr. Sandman, a classic 50's-looking African American with mean uppercuts; Super Macho Man, a self-absorbed champion with a thornado punch; and finally Mr. Dream, a Kurt-Angle look-alike reject who can knock you down with just one uppercut.

The controls are simple enough: A & B are punch buttons (holding Up while pressing either one results in a face-punch), Left and Right are for dodging, Down is for blocking (double-tap Down to duck), and Start is for a Super Punch provided you have at least one star. Unfortunately, you cannot pause the game so bathroom breaks must be taken between fights or rounds. As stated in my review of MTPO* (which Amazon.com may not have posted since I used a contraversial word), you play as Little Mac and your opponents are...* Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!In order of appearance: Glass Joe, a wuss who gives the French a bad name; Von Kaiser, a former boxing instructor from Germany; Piston Honda, an angry Japanese boxer; Don Flaminco, a flamboyant Spaniard who loves a woman named Carmen (San Diego perhapse?); King Hippo, a human tub of lard who wears size XXXL shorts and cannot get up once he is knocked down; Glass Tiger, an East-Indian with magic powers and a jewel (possibly The Eye of the Tiger) encrested into his turban; Bald Bull, an oddly familiar-looking fighter from Turkey; Soda Popinski, a soft-drink fanatic who loves soda and looks somewhat like Bald Bull except he's thinner and wears a speedo instead of shorts; Mr. Sandman, a classic 50's-looking African American with mean uppercuts; Super Macho Man, a self-absorbed champion with a thornado punch; and finally Mr. Dream, a Kurt-Angle look-alike reject who can knock you down with just one uppercut.
Everone knows that Nintendo is not quite known for creating fighting games. The company is known for its signature Super Mario, Donkey Kong, Zelda and Metroid games. However Nintendo teamed up with Rare to create a fighting game which used a technology similar to their hit 1994 game, Donkey Kong Country. The result was the arcade fighter Killer Instinct. The SNES version was releasd in 1995.The story behind the game, as with most fighting games, is quite lame. An organisation called &quot;Ultratech&quot; is pitting various fighters against each other for its own ulterior motives. There are ten fighters which are Thunder, Cinder, Glacius, Fulgore, Jago, Orchid, Riptor, Sabrewulf, Spinal and T.J. Combo. The characters themselves show a fair amount of variation, from the ninja-ish Jago to the robotic Fulgore to the dinosaur Riptor to the red indian Chief Thunder. The boss is Eyedol. The game offers a vast amount of moves for each character, including special moves, secret &quot;combo-breakers,&quot; ultra combos, finishing moves, humiliations (a bit like Mortal Kombat's &quot;friendships&quot;), stage fatalities and more. What Killer Instinct is really known for are the combos. Depending on the number of hits they range from &quot;triple&quot; to &quot;blaster&quot; to &quot;monster&quot; to &quot;ultra.&quot; Despite all this variation, I only enjoyed a few characters like Jago, Combo, Cinder and Thunder.Just as in the Donkey Kong Country games, the graphics are amazing. The backgrounds range from medieval castles to rooftops to factories to canyons. The fighters have fluid animation, flashy moves and various coloured outfits to choose from. The sound effects are not bad, but some characters make weird noises, for example, Cinder, Glacius and Riptor. The music is extremely well done. Each background has music which matches its atmosphere. I loved Jago's stage back then (a bit like Ryu's from Street Fighter II). The game controls quite well, but some attacks are unavoidable and quite often you'll get beaten up by some cheap move, despite how strategic you get. The game balance is also a bit off. If you want to win, choose Combo, Jago or Fulgore. If you want to lose, pick Sabrewulf, Riptor or Spinal. Ironically, the computer controlled Spinal provides a good challenge. Eyedol is also a worthy opposition, but like I said above, if you make a single wrong move somewhere, you may end up getting beaten up continuously until you die.Overall however, for a company that's been making side-scrolling action games and adventure games, Killer Instinct is a surprisingly good effort in the fighting game department. If you want a really solid game for your SNES, with great graphics and music that will provide hours of fun and amusement, Killer Instinct is for you.

This game has an extensive bunch of moves, maneuvers, special items, secrets and it has a huge amount of Spiderman memorabilia in it. This is a very detailed Spiderman game because it is a whole 3D world, you as Spiderman or one of his six playable alter egos can swing from building to building, hang upside-down, create a web shield, web the band guys or create web boxing gloves. Everyone is included, like Venom, Carnage, the Scorpion, Rhino, and a 50 ft Mysterio. You must beat them each in a unique way, rather than just beating them up. There are twenty-five levels, however, the big downfall is that you can beat the game from beginning to end in only two or three hours, which makes it like a movie. To add playability to the game you can pick up secret outfits, characters, 3D profiles on bad guys and even comicbook covers documenting the history of the comic.

Let me preface this review by saying that I'm a Nintendo and Zelda fan. I have played all the Zelda games except for the CD-i games, and have beaten "Ocarina of Time", "Wind Waker" and "Twilight Princess". When 3DS was released in North America, I did not get it on day one, but I did get it on day three, and when "Ocarina of Time 3D" was released, I beat it three times, one for each save file you get. I had to delete a save file to play it a fourth time.You are probably thinking that a main-series, console Zelda release can never be less than gaming perfection. However, I would beg to differ, pointing you to "Zelda II: The Adventure of Link". "Skyward Sword" is the second coming of "Zelda II" in that respect, and it has done the unthinkable and finally supplanted it as the most disappointing Zelda game of all time. If you have not played this game, you have no idea how terrible it is, so before you judge this review and vote it down, I implore you to read this review and other "negative" (I prefer the term "honest") reviews before making your own decision about purchasing this game. Nintendo has really dropped the ball with this game. The release of the MotionPlus accessory never really generated the second life for the Wii that they intended, so they forced it into a traditional core gaming franchise and the result is "Skyward Sword".The controls are very bad. Almost every action involving the Wii remote is filled with frustration and stress - from flying to just simply trying to cut grass. Very early on, you get a taste of flying. However, the controls are overly sensitive, yet unresponsive at the same time - the worst of both worlds. For example, you will tilt the controller to the left to turn left, but there will be slight lag until your bird actually turns. To make up for this lag, you will be tilting the controller even more than necessary. By the time you do this, your bird finally has turned, but the extra turning you have done to compensate for the lag has made the bird turn even more than necessary. It's not just the lag that accounts for the bad controls, either. It is just too sensitive. A slight tilt of the controller will cause it to turn a lot, and there is no way to adjust the sensitivity. This is not how we were taught how to fly in real life, or in video games. Flying by tilting a horizontally-aligned controller is simply unintuitive.The sword-controls are terrible as well. Cutting grass - something that has been a staple of the franchise since "Link to the Past", is now needlessly difficult. In Twilight Princess, one could simply shake the controller, and Link, your on-screen avatar, would effectively cut grass. In this game, simply shaking the controller is not enough; oh no. You must be precise and shake it horizontally, because grass grows vertically, and thus to cut it, you must chop it horizontally. Now this would not be that big of a deal if when every time or at least 90% of the time you performed a horizontal slice with your controller, Link did the same. However, this is not the case. Also, every little, seemingly innocuous enemy in the game now has become a mini-boss encounter, where precise timing and sword strokes are needed for victory. This is an extrinsic vicissitude for the Zelda series. It slows the gameplay down, and breaks up the pacing.Here are some more examples of the horrible controls:This is not so egregious in execution, but is in theory: walking across a tightrope. When Link walks across a tightrope, he will alternately teeter to the left and right - not because you are failing to hold the controller steady, but because Nintendo programmed him to do so. At first, I was wondering why I was teetering to the left and right when I was holding the controller steady. Then I realized that instead of programming tightrope sequences so that Link's movement intuitively mirrored the player, as in all the other actions, like flying and sword-swinging, they repudiated that philosophy for this one type of event, making the player react to Link's movements, rather than the other way around. This makes no sense in the commonsense, logical desire of having one theoretical, uniform game design philosophy.In another example of paradoxical, inconsistent game design philosophy, the "Sheikah Stone" makes a reappearance. It made its first appearance in "Ocarina of Time 3D", and it gives players hints when consulted. One of the caveats of this tool is that it is only accessible on Skyloft, the main hub area. The inclusion of the "Sheikah Stone" baffles me to a certain extent. I can see how this will help the more casual gamers, but when the controls are unresponsive, rendering the game difficult beyond the reach of casual gamers, I do not see the point of its inclusion. My point is that a "Sheikah Stone" should have been the last thing on Nintendo's list of considerations. Their priority should have been to fix the controls, and then a "Sheikah Stone" would have been unnecessary.Killing skulltulas is another thing that has been greatly overcomplexified. In "Ocarina of Time", killing skulltulas had a short learning curve, but it was understandable and intuitive: if you got too close, it faced you constantly, rendering it invulnerable to your sword. If you got too far from it, it retreated beyond your reach. At just the right distance, it would first drop down and then turn around, exposing its vulnerable underbelly for a brief moment, giving you an opportunity to strike. In "Skyward Sword", however even after much trial and error, I could not figure out how to defeat one. I soon ventured forth into the internet in search of a method, and was satisfied when I realized that I was not alone in my troubles. Of course, I also found snarky simpletons who, instead of helping people like me, proceeded to insult them for lack of "skill" and took their skulltula-killing troubles as an offensive gesture to their beloved God and king: the almighty Nintendo.One of the most egregious vicissitudes in "Skyward Sword" is save-points. Their philosophy was probably twofold: 1) it is not just a save point - you can do some other stuff, like taking to the skies, and it serving as a waypoint as well, and 2) maybe they found that people did not know how to save in Zelda games so they included save-points. The first reason is understandable - adding functionality. The second reason, however, is egregious. In other Zelda games, you can save nearly anywhere. You may not start at that exact location when you turn the system off and return, but your progress will be saved. In "Skyward Sword", you must first find a save point, and then when you want to stop playing and save, you must either keep playing and hope to find a save-point, or return to a save point you have already found and then save, wasting time that did not need to be wasted. This is an example of removing functionality: a bad thing.Navi-itis returns. You remember how annoying Navi was in "Ocarina of Time"? Well, the spiritual successor is here. I won't spoil anything but I will warn you that if your shield is about to break (yes, shields can break in this game - how asinine is that?), or even if you are low on hearts, this Navi-wannabe will annoy you. I think that the traditional pinging sound that was there from "Zelda 1" tells me all I need to know about how low on hearts I am!Nintendo seems to be feeling the pressure of being more like "Monster Hunter". They have unnecessarily added millions of little knick-knacky materials to collect through the course of your playthrough. These materials can be used to upgrade your items. This is not too bad, since it's optional, but when you come across a material, for example: a feather or a skull, the game must go into an animation of Link holding it up, then it tells you what it is, and then it goes into the menu, showing you how many of it you have. Then, you must exit the menu, if you want to keep playing. Every time you turn off your Wii or quit a play-sesion and then come back to play, if you find something for the first time for that playthrough, it does this again. It's unnecessary and annoying. The same thing happens for the higher-echelon rupees. At least it doesn't do it for blue rupees (worth 5) anymore like in "Twilight Princess".Another thing Nintendo has unnecessarily adopted into its game is a partial form of "floating combat text". In many other traditional RPGs, when you hit something or it hits you, numbers pop up indicating damage done or dealt. In this game, when you get hit, the same thing happens, but with hearts (e.g. if you lose two hearts, in addition to losing two hearts on your life meter, a "- [heart icon][heart icon]" will appear next to it). This is unnecessary and insults the player's intelligence. If I had five hearts and something hit me, and I now have three hearts, I can do the math and figure out that I lost two. I don't need the game to show me.Nintendo knew this game was hard. At first I was taken aback at how Link started off with six hearts. Usually he starts off with three, no? Then I played the first dungeon. "Oh... That's why."Not all is bad in "Skyward Sword", however. Theoretically, I like the idea of taking a Zelda game into the sky, like how "Wind Waker" was an entire Zelda game built around the theme of wind and the ocean. Also, the new stamina-meter, which I disliked at first, grew on me, and I learned to appreciate it. For example, Link can now move faster than his run (let's call the faster run a "sprint") without having to roll around all over the place, and he can run into a wall at this speed without bumping into it and subsequently falling down, for the "roll" has been remapped to the nunchuk's accelerometer. To roll, all one has to do is sprint and then shake the nunchuk.A new Zelda game wouldn't be complete without some new puzzle-types. I liked moving the key around with the controller to fit into a lock, although it featured reverse controls (up is down, left is right, etc.). In this respect, it does a good job of creating some new puzzles. Incremental challenge is a good thing, as long as the controls don't get in the way of it. As you now know, however, it does get in the way of it. After getting through the first two dungeons, I realized that the most difficult small-fry enemy was one of the first ones you meet: the piranha-plant thingies. This is an example of incorrectly increasing the difficulty of a game.Also of positive note: the "Deku Leaf" makes a return, although it is called the "Sailcloth" now. Functionally, it works the same as the "Deku Leaf". Unfortunately, this welcome return is simultaneously met with an unwelcome alteration in the controls. This item is controlled with the "Wii Remote Plus", and, you guessed it, the controls are terrible. Near the beginning of the game, you must use this item to land on a small circle on the ground. I tried at least 20 times before I was able to land on it. Eventually, I realized that the less you moved the controller, the better off you were. You were not controlling the game; you were simply giving the game the input it desired to perform the output you wanted. This is a big change from how most video games are designed. Most video games empower the player and give them the illusion that they're imposing their will upon the game. "Skyward Sword", on the other hand, forces you to play by its rules and molds the player into its own, unwilling pawn. Maybe that's why some people like this game. They are unknowingly pawns and tools in the universe, and thus enjoy or are used to being in this position in the world.I found that the most effective way of fighting the Bokoblins (red bad-guys) was not to swing the controller at their weak points but to wait for them to drop their guard, and in that second before they attack, you the player should strike quickly. Waiting for an opening? I understand using that philosophy for designing boss battles, but small-fry enemies should not have been designed like this.The graphics are a mixed bag. Sometimes, especially during cutscenes, I was impressed at what the Wii was capable of. I found myself thinking, "Is that FMV?" However, at other times, these times being most of the time, I found myself thinking, "This looks worse than 'Twilight Princess'." A lot of the animations and models seem to be ripped straight from that game, tweaked a negligible amount, and then daubed with a low-detail, saturated, faded-rainbow paintbrush. Everything looks washed-out and all the colors seem to bleed together, like a watercolor painting done by an elementary school student. It is hard to tell what is what from a distance. I know what Nintendo was thinking when they went in this artistic direction. They knew they could not compete graphically in the realism department with "Xbox 360" nor "Playstation 3", so they went in the opposite direction of accentuating their "superior" artistic vision, so that the Wii's graphical shortcomings would be ignored with a lush, unique, graphical style. However, it fails to deliver on its intentions. I am not opposed to non-realistic graphics. Oh no. "Wind Waker" is one of the most beautiful games ever created, and looks miles better than this game. "Wind Waker" was designed to be a "cartoon that you play" - this coming straight from Miyamoto's own mouth, and I wholeheartedly agree. "Skyward Sword", on the other hand, feels like a rainbow threw up on a Miyazaki film. It just doesn't work. Also, why does Link have to look so much like Michael Jackson? Could he not have looked a little more human, and less extra-terrestrial? Nintendo got his face wrong in "Twilight Princess", right in "Super Smash Bros. Brawl", then even fixed "Twilight Princess" Link's face for the "Wii U" Zelda tech demo at E3 this year, but lost it again for Skyward Sword.The music is surprisingly bad as well. The soundtrack sounds less like a Zelda game, and more like a generic JRPG soundtrack. After looking up the credits online, I found that a whole stable of composers not named Koji Kondo was involved in it. "Ah..." My suspicions were correct.Nintendo needs to bring Miyamoto back to the director's chair. He understands that gameplay is paramount. When you first start up Skyward Sword, you are bogged down with cutscenes and meaningless fluff in the form of small-talk conversations with NPCs. You may have thought "Twilight Princess" got off to a slow start, but holy snap, "Skyward Sword" takes it to the next level. If the story and characters were half-interesting, maybe I would care, but unfortunately it is not. People play Zelda games for the gameplay, not the story and cinematic work.It is not the idea of motion-controls in a Zelda game that is the problem here. It is in the execution, which is very bad. If there is copious ambiguity whether my failure to succeed is because it is not what I am supposed to do (as in the proper method of solving a problem) or it is because the controls are not responding to what I want to do, it is a major problem. As the great James Rolfe (the "Angry Video Game Nerd") once said, the number one important thing about a game is "being able to ****ing play it". I would love to swing my controller and be able to hit the enemies in their weak-spots, quickly and deftly; however, this is not possible because of the horrible control-response. I would love to be able to quickly transition from a neutral state to a rolling state when dealing with bombs, and then dexterously aim it to my own choosing. Again, this is not possible because of the horrible controls. "Twilight Princess" was evidence of how motion-controls could enhance a game to make a game greater than the sum of its parts. "Twilight Princess" on the Wii was easily superior to the Gamecube version. "Skyward Sword", on the other hand, obtrudes the game with its motion-controls, effectively making a gamer lesser than the sum of its parts. I wish there was a Gamecube version of this game.Let me now discuss my rationale for giving it 1 star: If you mouse over the respective stars, from the fifth star to the first star (furthest to the right, to the star furthest to the left), the mouse-over descriptions are as follows: "I love it", "I like it", "It's OK", "I don't like it", and "I hate it"."I love it" would be something I would say about "Ocarina of Time", and I have thought it to myself, and have even said it out loud to my friend back in 1999 or 2000. These games leave you in awe, feeling like a kid again. Those memories of getting a brand-new game for Thanksgiving-break or Christmas and playing it after you rip through the plastic wrap come flooding back to you. "Super Mario 64" and "Twilight Princess" are more examples."I like it" would be something I would say about "Wind Waker". The art direction was revolutionary, but the gameplay seemed to be an incremental evolution from "Ocarina of Time". In other words, it was good, but it did not blow my mind. That is fine; not every game can blow your mind."It's OK" is something I would say about "Metroid Prime". I was never a big fan of the Metroid series, but I did give Metroid Prime a shot and eventually beat it, but sometimes people have different tastes. These tastes are not meant to offend anybody."I don't like it" would be something I would say about "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion". It did not do much for me, coming from an MMORPG like "World of Warcraft" and trying to capture that magic in single-player form; I have since yet to find a single-player RPG that has really kept me engaged for as long as an MMORPG. I rue the day I ever bought that game (WoW); it spoiled me. Still, I would not say that I hate Oblivion, because there is nothing fundamentally flawed about it; it's just ugly, boring, and not for me."I hate it" is not something I say often about video games. I do my research and I have a sixth sense when it comes to buying games and it does not involve internet game-reviews. But when a game is this fundamentally flawed, as in the controls don't work (forget about the design, which is secondary), we have a problem. The only thing I can compare "Skyward Sword" to off the top of my head is a really difficult NES game that is cheap (by cheap, I mean the AI is cheap) beyond imagination and is likely to have been reviewed by James Rolfe. Indeed, whilst playing "Skyward Sword", I found myself thinking and saying out loud many of his epithets like "What were they thinking?" and "This game is horrible!" I know there is a "first impressions" video on cinemassacre.com regarding this game, but it was made not by Rolfe, but by his friend Mike Matei. I would like to hear Rolfe's own opinions about this game.This has been the most disappointing holiday game lineup in recent history - from the overhyped "Battlefield 3", the most iterative game of all time: "Modern Warfare 3", the still-ugly-with-terrible-melee-combat Skyrim... What in the world is going on? God save us all.
Metroid has got to be my favorite series of all time:  non-linear exploration, epic battles, and superbly entertaining weapons and power-ups which you get both by following the story line and by NOT following it at all.  No matter what you did, you were either going to be entertained by challenging fights, challenging puzzles, or just the sheer joy of exploration.  You were always alone, but it was alright--Samus just seemed so unflinching.Those days are gone, possibly for good if Nintendo allows for the next Metroid game (if there will be one) to follow this one's design.  You aren't allowed to explore at will anymore, the storyline is bent out of shape, the controls are annoying, the voice acting is bad, and Samus is unrealistically vulnerable as a character.On the Metroid timeline this story falls right after Super Metroid--Zebes is destroyed, along with the last Space Pirate stronghold, not to mention the last Metroids.  After so many years of fighting the Pirates Samus is seemingly left without a cause and begins to resume her old life as a bounty hunter when she picks up a distress signal coming from a remote space station; she decides to investigate and finds that the station she lands on is teeming with dangerous life forms, and the only other humans are a small squad of Federation soldiers.  But not just any soldiers, because two of them used to fight with Samus when she was part of the Army:  Anthony Higgins and Adam Malkovich.  Malkovich was her commanding officer, and this is the precept for just about every cinematic sequence of the game.Unfortunately, this is also the first problem with the game.  Of the time spent playing your are going to have several hours of mandatory, non-skippable cinemas.  So instead of providing you with a game which has in depth gameplay AND an in depth cinematic, you have to watch movie after movie after movie.  The point of this game comes off as being more about Samus's relationship with her previous teammates than the current investigation of the death of almost every human aboard the space station.This doesn't sound too terribly bad, to be honest, because Samus is a character who has been shrouded in mystery pretty much since day one.  It's only natural that we would want to get to know her a little more personally, but unfortunately this ruins the dynamic of a Metroid style game because if you have to pursue the storyline as the movies dictate the joy of exploration just isn't there.  You're meant to find everything you find, to get every power-up you get; your effort (the player's effort) is actually quite minimal.  There's no element of puzzle-solving at all in this game, which is another major departure from the rest of the series.  If you see a door that you can't yet open (because you don't have the right power-up) you aren't allowed to backtrack to open it up after you do have the right power-up unless that area is where the story requires you to be.  And I mean it when I say that you aren't allowed to backtrack--certain doors will be locked (even if you've been through them before) depending on where you are in the story and will not open again until much later.  The designers of the game talked about 'the joy of discovery' in this game; ironically you aren't allowed to discover anything they don't want you to discover.As mentioned, this rigid gameplay is linked to the story, which as a story only sort-of works.  Yes, it's good to get a deeper glimpse of Samus's past, but to make the game focus almost entirely on the past makes things a little less enjoyable.  Especially when you consider that as story lines get more and more complex, and that the tradition in Metroid is to start out with nothing and build your way up, you need an explanation for why Samus doesn't have her full range of gear at the start.  In this game you are denied use of your gear in the beginning on grounds that you are working with other troops and that stray fire from your much more powerful weapons could kill someone; if you need something more intense Malkovich (being the CO) will authorize it.  Sounds logical, until you consider that there are items in Samus's arsenal that wouldn't hurt anyone.  Like the Varia Suit, for example; all it does is reduce damage from enemies and protect Samus from temperature extremes.  Yet there is a part in the game where you have to run through a super-heated area, taking damage from both the heat and the enemies all at the same time, while Malkovich refuses to let you turn on your Varia suit feature.  You're getting cooked to death, which Malkovich knows, but he refuses to let you save yourself.  The same thing goes for the Gravity Suit and the Space Jump--both are perfectly harmless, but you're not allowed to use them because Malkovich says no.  (This in itself is also a huge departure and very un-Samus-like, as Samus usually just does whatever she wants.)  And to make the irony complete, you spend most of your time alone.  No other soldiers to endanger nearby...  Lots of large and dangerous creatures everywhere...  But still no plasma beam...The controls were (largely) designed to work like the classic SNES controls as this game takes a third person perspective.  You hold the remote horizontally and use the d-pad and a couple of buttons for the majority of the game.  But, the game producers forgot that the gaming world is largely in 3D now so a little directional pad with only four directions doesn't quite let you do everything you need to do.  Like walking diagonally, for example.  Or dodging enemies.  To be fair, the designers tried to introduce a Matrix-style dodging technique complete with special killing blows, all of which sounds cool and sounds classic considering how Samus would always be doing multiple flips in mid-air and jumping off walls in the older 2-D games.  But in this game the Matrix-style moves are not an option, they are a requirement.  Some enemies take a very long time to kill without these killing blows, and because this is a 3D game every time you try to dodge you are going to be facing the wrong direction.  This is because the dodging is all done on the D-Pad which is also how you move and change direction.  That's right, you have to press the D-Pad in the right direction at the right moment to dodge because walking won't get you out of the line of fire fast enough.  You can still change directions during these dodges, which means that if you do so unintentionally (very easy with a d-pad) you will not be facing your enemy, a big problem if you intend on actually killing your enemy quickly.  Don't rely on the auto-targeting either; because the game is 3D with 2D controls the designers included an auto-aim feature, which doesn't always do the logical thing (target the closest enemy you are facing).  You'll be doing more dodging than you really want to.  What's worse, there is no control to allow you to center the camera behind Samus--you will be ambushed because of that and you will take a lot of damage because of that ambushing.To be brief about the voice acting, the narrations are bland and the lines for the cutscenes are not at all what you would expect from a bounty hunter who has just spent the past few years helping the war effort, and had spent many years before that on her own as a bounty hunter.  You would expect Samus to be blunt, terse or maybe even rude.  Instead she is quiet and unnaturally polite, not to mention verbose.  Not what you would expect from someone whose CO basically let her burn on the station rather than turn on her temperature protection suit...Which brings us to Samus as a character.  As mentioned we would expect Samus to be tough and more than willing to bend the rules if she thinks she needs to because that' what she did in almost every other game.  But for the duration of the game, Samus just does whatever Malkovich asks; most of the cinemas (remember that they are usually 20 minutes or longer, and you can't skip) become soap operas of Samus's past.  Samus is depicted as being sensitive in this game, which is normal for a human being but her sensitivity is so extreme that it gets in the way--literally.  At one point she confronts Ridley and goes into a panic attack that prevents her from fighting.  But any Metroid fan will remember that by this point in the Metroid timeline Samus has fought Ridley a grand total of five (5) times without panicking in the slightest...  Why this time, I don't know.  It makes no sense, and the warrior who has always managed to conquer her fears in the face of death suddenly can't fight back...  I'm sorry, but the designers destroyed Samus as a character.  To be emotional is normal, but if you can be reduced to a crying, blubbering mass instantly odds are you aren't a bounty hunter who has just spent the past few years in the middle of a war.Samus is also unrealistic physically, which of course leads to sexploitation.  Everyone who has ever seen gameplay scenes from a Metroid game would have to admit that Samus is extremely athletic, almost gymnastically so.  In this game, however, there are numerous cutscenes of Samus in her Zero-Suit (so form fitting that it might as well be called a birthday suit) and you can tell she's very well... endowed around the waist and the bosom.  Compare that to a real athletic woman (especially a gymnast) and you will know that something is wrong; there is no justification for her physical design as a character, and you have to ask yourself why the programmers designed her this way.  Considering her figure and just how tight her suit I am tempted to say her design borders on the pornographic.  I would definitely urge parents to think twice before letting their children play this game.  Samus is not a warrior in this game, she's a pin-up girl.In many ways Samus is the game, and in this game she just is not believable.  She's not the tough, independent character we expect given her circumstances and personal history, she's a submissive quasi-crybaby.  Furthermore, giving her long monologues and cutscenes was a big risk on the part of the game designers, one that did not pay off; they not only damaged her character but damaged the genre altogether.  Keeping Samus quiet in the other titles let you feel involved; you didn't just control Samus, you were Samus.  That was why Metroid was always so much fun.  But in this game, you're not Samus anymore.  Instead you're just watching her, usually in cutscenes that go on and on.  There isn't much fun in cutscenes, which is why most serious gamers skip each and every one.
Wow, if you are a fan of previous Star Fox video games (not including the horrendous "Star Fox Adventures" that was one of the first releases for the Gamecube) I have bad news for you...The newest addition to the series, Star Fox: Assault, is a huge disappointment.  It is horrible.  SOOOOOOO bad.  I looked forward to this game so much, and now I play it, literally had to force myself just to continue and cling to the hope that it could get better. But it never did get better.  In fact, I think it is safe to say the game goes steadily downhill after you defeat the first boss.  Well, maybe not so steady, the "fun" of the game completely disappears the third or fourth time you have to wander around on foot and destroy some variation of "shield generator".  I am not going to get too much further into that in this format though.  I want to make a list of all the reasons this game is horrible.1) of the 10 levels I played through, there were only 3 where you spent the majority of the time in your plane.  The rest of the time you spent performing tedious tasks on foot or in the "Landmaster" on the horribly designed ground levels.  Each time you are on foot you start with one of the crappiest guns I have ever used in a video game.  It cannot kill anything in one shot, has a painfully slow rate of fire, and an even slower charge up time (the enemies that only take damage from charged shots fire at a much faster rate).  This could be solved by a handful of things.  A) if the controls allowed you to dodge, charge your gun and aim at the same time.  Most console shooters incorporate a 2-stick control system (like that in Halo or Timesplitters).  If you want 2-stick control in this game, you have to adjust to wacked out control in your plane.  By wacked out I mean it makes you control the plane with one stick and the camera with the other.  This is just stupid.  The one stick control leads to several control problems.  I'll get to that in a minute.  B) easily obtained weapon upgrades.  Not only are new guns (machine gun, grenades etc.) scarce, but once you find one, they have limited ammunition.  AND switching between them is a pain (using c-stick to change weapons!?!?).  It also annoyed me that you do not get to hold onto your guns from level to level.  The design of the foot levels is almost too bad to describe with words.  Everything is camoflauged.  It is very difficult to distinguish enemies, doors and important items from the surrounding area.  enemies aren't too bad in this case, because they show up on your radar.  But you are not given a map to any of these levels, so finding doors, and knowing where to go next is a huge pain in the ass.  AND as if the ground levels could get any worse, the developers some how managed to ruin the "Landmaster".  The "Landmaster" is a tank that was introduced in Star Fox 64.  It offered a nice change of pace in that game, requiring quick side to side movement and well planned hops to clear obstacles.  In this game not only is the "Landmaster" lethargic (it was very fast on the 64), but the hovering and rolling abilities are rarely needed (the dodging that required these moves in the 64 game is what made the landmaster fun).  There is really no need to have the Landmaster in this game.  This is the last thing I will say about the ground levels.  While you are running around on foot with your crappy gun, with the rest of the Star Fox team flying around above you, they STILL request back up from you.  They expect that you will be able to land multiple shots on multiple enemies at great distance while dealing with the phantom enemies that appear out of nowhere on the ground.  This requires you to go into "aim mode", you cannot move while you are aiming, lead one of the 3-5 enemies tailing your friend, and land at least several shots from your pistol on each one within approximately 60 seconds of the original distress signal.  After scrambling (and failing miserably) the first time this happened, I decided to let my team mates "die", because unlike in the other games, where you were punished for this and your team mates actually made a difference, your team mates never appear to do anything helpful in this game and return for the next mission no matter what.2)  The Controls are horrible.  I touched on this a little in the previous gripe.  But I still can't believe just how bad they are.  You cannot assign the buttons however you want to.  You have 3-schemes  to choose from.  One is good for the plane, but horrible for the foot/Landmaster portions of the game.  The second one is good for the foot and landmaster portions, but is terrible for the plane portions.  The third one is horrible for everything... I really don't know why they included it, it is needlessly complicated.  The challenge of a game should not be adjusting to the control scheme.  They could have saved all of this trouble and restricted the game play to the plane... I think everyone (myself and any respectable star fox fan) would have been just fine with that.3)  The story is poorly written.  The old star fox games did not have great stories, but they made up for this by ignoring the story element of the game.  This game tries to push the story as important, and implies relationships between various characters, which isn't a bad thing to do, it is just executed poorly in this game.  Most of the voice acting is second rate at best.  Falco turned is no longer a cocky rebel with a quick tongue, but a mellow "surfer dude" with an annoying attitude.  The girl fox never really proves that she serves a purpose other than weak attempts to seduce Fox.  Fox's voice switches between a Keanu Reeve's type effect where he sounds perpetually lost, and an over anxious "I have done this a million times before I can't die I am the hero" voice.  Which is annoying because in the SNES and 64 games he always came off as someone who is humble, but actively seeking revenge.  Oh, and Slippy is more homosexual than ever before.  All the new enemies suck too.  And I won't even get into the whole mess of a story where you team up with the "Star Wolf" team more often than you fight them...4)  Ok, so running around on foot sucks, driving the landmaster sucks, I would have thought they would at least salvage the Arwing portions of play.  I mean it shouldn't be too hard, there are only 3 levels that are exclusive to the Arwing.  Well... the flying sucks too.  It is slower.  You turn slower.  You can't do the useful "turn on one side" move to get through tight spots which makes the Arwings width a huge burden.  Whenever you "spin" to deflect enemy shots it makes this huge engine blast that prevents you from seeing anything happening ahead of you.  The "rail" portions of the level are plagued by the stage moving into your plane and enemies flying into the back of your ship (possibly the most frustrating part of the game).  The "free" portions are hurt by the speed of the Arwing (so sloooooooooow) and large, stationary ships cluttering up the battlefield (ally calls for help and they are on the other side of a huge ship, there is no way to get there in time, especially when your radar gives you no idea of how much distance is between the two of you).  You also start with no bombs, and do not retain the upgrades you find in the levels, as you did in the previous games.  This is very annoying in this game because the upgrades and pickups are very scarce, so you spend most of the plane levels with a crappy single laser (this sounds familiar...).  On top of all of this, the flying bosses seem recycled and old.  For example, the first boss is identical to Andross (main boss in the SNES and 64 versions).  While I'm on the topic of bosses, they are all very easy.  Not only easy to kill, but easy to figure out.  No thinking required here.5)  The radar is barely helpful.  In previous Star Fox games, radar was only used in "free" flight periods of the game.  When it was used though, it showed you EVERYTHING.  So you knew the direction and had an idea of the distance between yourself and friends and foes.  The area it displays now barely extends past your plane/landmaster/self.  So you have lots of colored dots lining the perimeter of your radar... this is not very helpful when an ally cries for help...6) This may sound stupid, but it annoyed me that Peppy is no longer one of the Star Fox pilots.  He has been replaced by the blue fox thing that you rescue in Star Fox Adventures.  He is still in the game, but hangs out in the Great Fox and *SPOILER* he dies.  Or at least he appeared to have killed himself at the point in the game that I stopped playing because it was killing me to see one of my favorite game franchises perverted like this.There are probably more things that I have missed.  This game is unbelievably bad.  I quit playing on what I am pretty sure is the last level because I was fed up with enemies flying into the back of my ship (in the "rail" portions of this game it is impossible to prevent this), and my best efforts being wasted by the stage shifting into my ship when I would turn at high speeds (it felt like the game was having to catch up to me).  I don't know why they (developers) keep tampering with this game.  Star Fox is not complicated.  Make enemies fly through in patterns, award points for shooting them down, have the stage collapse/change in front of you in time for you to get an idea of the pattern the gates will close, but quick enough so you will be forced to make choices (left or right, up or down, boost or break, flip on your side or stay flat).  It isn't hard... it isn't even that complicated.  Grounding me, Fox McCloud, leader of the Star Fox team, makes no sense at all.  The game is called STAR Fox.  Not RUN AROUND AND COLLECT STUFF Fox, or SHOOT BUGS WITH A SISSY PISTOL Fox, or LAND LOCKED DESTROYER OF FORCE FIELDS Fox.  It is STAR Fox.  STAR, like the things you find in outter space.  A game with such an obvious name should not be spent running around searching for alien spawn points.Despite the ridiculous controls, this game was still very easy, which just adds to the poor quality.  Bad story, horrible gameplay, really easy.  I will give one of the other control schemes another run tomorrow... But I doubt that will change anything.  This game sucks.  I am going to email Nintendo and complain, tell them how they are killing one of their best franchises... not really.  But it is true.  I should have known by the disgusting remixed theme song that played at the openning screen that this would be a disgusting remixed version of the first 3D game I ever played (going back to play the SNES Star Fox and remembering how its graphics were once revelutionary... wow, progress is funny).

I realize this game was released in 1994, which happens to be the year I was most interested in video games, and specifically, Super NES games.  I was addicted to the Super NES and probably played the darn thing every single day for the entire year.  I knew at the time that games like Zelda: Link to the Past were considered classics, and most people had that game and enjoyed it (though I can remember a few people who said they hated it, which is their opinion and they're entitled to it).  Back then I also knew that Zelda was not only an improvement over the original Legend of Zelda on the NES, but also an influence on many, many RPGs that the Super NES would soon have plenty of (and eventually be looked upon as the ultimate video game system when it came to RPGs).Unfortunately, I never gave much notice to many of the RPGs back then, and instead I focused on Mario, Metroid and the Donkey Kong Country series.  For the most part, you can say I was more interested in platform games.  Back then I figured "I have Zelda, I don't need anymore similar type games".  Well, I admit I was wrong when I thought Zelda was the only good RPG on the Super NES, but in some cases, such as with Illusion of Gaia, I see that some games were *clearly* inferior to Zelda (despite the fact that popular gaming magazines back in 1994 praised Illusion of Gaia for being just as good as Zelda).  Now, I've only just experienced Illusion of Gaia for the first time a week ago, which would be in the middle of January 2006.  I missed out on this game in 1994.  It was probably best to leave it that way.Right off the bat I'm bothered by the life bar for your main character.  You have a series of blue dots that serve as your life, and these dots are basically the same thing as your heart life bar from the Zelda series, and your main character goes around smacking enemies with his sword, just like Link.  Okay, it's not a sword, it's a flute.  Same thing, really.  But the game as a whole does leave you wondering if the game company (Enix) was trying to fool gamers into thinking this was something new and refreshing.  Years later, you can tell Illusion of Gaia is NOT so fresh, and in fact, it has a strong, dated feeling attached to it, I think.  People knew Zelda was the better game back then, and they still do to this day.  You can't fool gamers.  Some of the animation in Illusion of Gaia isn't quite up to the standard of other games at the time.  For instance, the way your main character Will runs around flapping his arms, and the way he slides into enemies.  It looks clunky and uninspiring.  The graphics in Illusion of Gaia, while colorful, detailed, and big, doesn't really have that extra something that makes Zelda: Link to the Past look so appealing.  It doesn't have that certain spark; or polished graphics.  Enix probably thought they created something special with this game, but it hasn't really held up over the years (except with a few hardcore gamers).To switch gears and say something positive about the game, I think people are crazy to say the music in this game is bad.  Sure, it's not music you can instantly sing and dance to, but it's music that will grow on you the more you hear it.  It's really good music.  Just because you can't sing along to music doesn't mean it's not good.  This game is a great example of that.  The music is great, in every area.  To compare the music in this game to that in Actraiser.  I'd say the tunes in Illusion of Gaia overall cannot touch the high points in Actraiser, but they sure beat the low points, easily.  I remember one level theme in Actraiser had me pulling my hair out.  Nothing like that in Illusion of Gaia.Maybe there's something wrong with my copy, but I've been having strange things happen.  For example, I reached the end of the game with 18 blue dots (let me mention again that these blue dots represent your life bar).  Okay, I shut the game off, go to sleep for 8 hours, wake up, play the game... and now I have 20 blue dots.  How did THAT happen?  Imagine if you were playing Zelda and you didn't collect all your heart containers, and then you wake up to find all the heart pieces right there on your file the next day!  That's what it's like in Illusion of Gaia.  Also, sometimes save points suddenly appear out of nowhere, and you clearly remember the last time you ran by that area a save point wasn't there.  So save points can appear and disappear.  Weird.  I also got stuck in one area of the game because an item that was supposed to be given to me by one of the characters WASN'T given to me, leaving me to forever wander around doing nothing.  I had no choice but to start over completely.  I have no idea what's going on here.  I've never experienced anything like this in ANY video game, and I've played my share of games!  I can only assume either my copy has a defect, or Enix is just a cheap game company (and Actraiser is pretty good, so it must be the former).I have to take a point off for the constant frustration found in most of the dungeons.  You know how in a Zelda game when you walk into a dungeon and each of the rooms are filled with interesting and creative ideas, making it really fun to play the game over and over (and equally as important, making each room DISTINCT, so you know where you are?)  It's not quite like that here.  The design of the dungeons in Illusion of Gaia is, for the most part, bland and confusing.  You just run around slashing enemies, and there's not much in the way of interesting strategies to make it enjoyable for you to progress to the next room.  This is where you really have to admire the people who work on Zelda games.  They know how to make dungeon mazes interesting.  Zelda: Link to the Past featured ice, desert and water dungeons.  The people who did this game just made it sort of fun, but nothing truly memorable.  And the strategies to progress to the next room in Illusion of Gaia usually require something small and uninteresting (and sometimes obvious) making it feel more like a chore to do it.  And why does the very last dungeon maze in the game have only a few enemies?  We're talking about a BIG area to walk through, encountering the same couple enemies over and over.  Those laser eyeballs are EVERYWHERE and they're SO out of place for a final level in a game, and they're so easy to destroy.  Zelda: Link to the Past features WAY more enemies.  Compare the final level in this game to World 8 in Link to the Past.  Zelda destroys it.I hate how sometimes in the game you have to backtrack to clear a dungeon, which means going to the end of the dungeon to grab an important item, and then go back to the very beginning to complete it.  Many times, this is easier said than done.  Take that super-irritating vine level for example.  The entire world is covered in vines that serve as a path you walk on, and each vine looks *exactly* the same, so it's possible you can wander around for hours just trying to find your way out of there.  I can't tell you how many times I pressed pause to reach for my magic mirror, only to come to the realization that this isn't Zelda, and so I have nothing to bring me back immediately to the entrance of the dungeon.  But... running around slashing skeleton heads, bats, and other strange-looking creatures is usually a lot of fun (despite the strange animation from Will) but is all this WORTH the frustration you most likely will encounter from the dungeon mazes?  Only when in the right mood.  At the end of other dungeons you fight huge bosses.  There's a total of six of them, and I think this is the games very best feature because these bosses are really fun, and you have to try and discover the best way to defeat them.  I don't think they're difficult to defeat, except for the very last boss.  That one is HARD!Another bad thing about the game is the incredible amount of text you have to skim through.  The storyline is okay, but sometimes you don't feel like reading it which means you have to sit through a TON of text before the enemy-slashing section of the game comes in.  To start off the game, you have to sit through, even if you skim over it as quickly as possible, 10 MINUTES of text.  10 minutes of your characters talking to each other, and it's not even very interesting.  They say things to each other that typical children would say.  Eventually you will come across a love story between the children!  But hey, I'm no expert on RPGs, so you may very well find the dialogue to be the games strong point.  Given a choice between this and Zelda, make the right choice and go with Zelda.  It's slightly more expensive to buy, but definitely more worth it.  However, Illusion of Gaia is a pretty nice game on its own.  I know it sounds like I'm bashing the game, but I don't mean to.  Just don't go in expecting a classic.

I've already reviewed "Super Mario Bros. 3" elsewhere, with both the 8-Bit NES version and the "Super Mario All-Stars" version.  I don't want to spend a lot of time and space on "Super Mario Bros. 3" specifically, but instead focus on this port (which is based on the "Super Mario Allstars" version).  We all know "Super Mario Bros. 3" is a classic title.  So, let's dispense with the cursory introduction of "Super Mario Bros. 3".  Basically, this is just a copy and paste job from a short blurb I wrote in my 2004 review of "Super Mario All-stars"."SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3: The best selling game ever released independently, SMB3 greatly expanded the Mario universe with the introduction of several new enemies, Bowser's children (who was the mother, I wonder? Godzilla's ex?), and introduced cool new suites for Mario to wear. The game play was more expansive than ever, with cool new secrets to discover and eight tremendously large worlds. This game laid the foundation for so many other plat-formers, especially SUPER MARIO WORLD. While SMB2 felt like a weird detour, SMB3 took Mario back to the atmosphere or the original game, taking it a thousand different directions, and coming up with one of the best games ever developed. Although there were a few tweaks for the ALL STARS release (some levels got a few more coins to make it easy to access game secrets), like the other games this is tremendously faithful to the original NES release. That alone makes this essential playing"To further elaborate, there are a few cosmetic changes, but this is largely the All-stars port of "Super Mario Bros. 3" that we all know and adore.  Ok, we all love SMB3?  It's an eternal classic, etc, etc. Best game on the NES. Yada yada.  Everyone on the same page?  Good.Now, let's get to the problems of "Super Mario Advance 4", and yes, there are problems.  Well, one problem anyway.  And it's a BIG problem.  It's a little selling point called e-Reader compatibility.  What's so great about e-Reader cards you ask?  Well, I'm glad you asked.e-Reader cards features new content than can be added to pre-existing games.  In the case of "Super Mario Bros. 3", there were three specific types: Power-ups (which uploads specific items into Mario or Luigi's inventory list and can be used an unlimited amount of times), Demo Cards (which showed Mario speed-running, collecting enough coins to unlock a blue Toad House, or doing infinite 1-Up tricks - essentially, the hint videos of "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" six years before), and, wait for it . . . New Levels.Yes, you read right.  New levels.  Yes, Nintendo made NEW LEVELS to "Super Mario Bros. 3", and a whole new world called, appropriately enough, "World-e".  Note, these are not the 15 inaccesible levels embedded in the original NES "Super Mario Bros. 3" code. Nintendo released ten levels in Japan, the PAL reigion, and America, with two different series.  Fantastic, eh?  Awesome?No, not really.  In fact, as a Mario can you just feel cheated.  Why?  Well, for one, although Japan frequently gets exclusive content, Nintendo released a full TWENTY TWO additional new levels in Japan only, because (again, wait for it) . . . Nintendo discontinued the e-Card readerSo, what's frustrating here?  Mainly, Nintendo made THIRTY THREE NEW LEVELS (which, to put in perspective, is over a third of the original game, as "Super Mario Bros. 3" has 88 levels total), plus five re-made levels in "Super Mario Bros. 3" style of "Super Mario Bros.".  These were levels 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 1-4, and 2-1.  Also, in homage to "Super Mario World" there are five new coloured switches which effect gameplay in different ways, but again only were released in Japan.Although many think Boomerang Mario first appeared in "Super Mario 3D Land", actually he first appeared in these one-off levels on the e-Cards, but (with only one exception, "Slidin' the Slopes", where you can use a boomerang on that one level only, just like Goomba's Shoe on 5-3) no one outside of Japan got to play as Boomerang Mario.  2/3s of the e-cards appeared only in Japan.Another problem with the e-Cards?  In World-e, there are three mushroom houses, each featuring three specific mini-games.  To unlock these mushroom houses, you must get Advance Coins found in the new levels (a precursor to the Star Coins of the "New Super Mario Bros." series).  But here's the kicker.  Outside of Japan, there's only enough coins to access ONE of these three mini-games, because there's not enough currency in the ten levels that Nintendo actually did release to unlock the other two.In Europe, the gamers got screwed even worst than the Americans, with the e-Card functionality completely disabled, inaccessible through normal gameplay.For Mario fans, this is beyond disappointing.  Nintendo put so much effort into new content, and yet do to poor implementation the majority of gamers will not get to experience these fantastic levels.  The e-reader was also a failure, so the cards weren't available for very long anyway.  Had all this new content been released in the game proper, "Super Mario Advance 4" would be the definitive port of "Super Mario Bros. 3"; as it stands, there is only a vague sense of disappointment and incompletion for those who know about the new content.These are the true Lost Levels in the Mario universe, still commercially unreleased and widely difficult to play legitimately.  Note that the original "Super Mario Bros." had 32 levels.  These lost levels are 32 in number, along with three bonus levels and five remade levels.In the NES days that would be a full-length Mario title!

During the late 80's a duo of plumbers ruled the gaming industry. . .Mario along with his poorly recognized brother, Luigi.  Overshadowed by his rotund brother, Luigi has accepted Miyamoto's brace on a reputable spot for the GameCube.  Despite the fact that the green plumber lacks the highest of the high eminence when compared to his counterpart`s Super Mario World and Mario 64, Luigi's Mansion sends the player on one of the topmost experiences a game can frankly provide.  Although it does not live up to the demoralizing hopes for a weekly played platformer, Luigi's new 2D-like dance is incredible in all its rights.  Conversely, not taking the vital steps as a boundless platformer, Luigi's Mansion has one sticky, discernible shortcoming.  Spanning only and about six hours, the game will be a mixture of being awestruck or deeply saddened for those rummaging for a clear-cut Mario sequel.Luigi's Mansion lobs the player as Luigi, a spineless Ghostbuster.  Armed with a flashlight, the Hoover (a vacuum cleaner), and a Game Boy Horror (which serves as a  map), the mildly brave Luigi must investigate a haunted Mansion where each corner and crevice must be thoroughly searched for interleaving puzzles.  The puzzles work as a chain of sequence throughout the game, marking advancement into the vast halls.  Each room, gushing with several hordes of terrorizing ghouls, must be explored in order to attain keys where entry is denied.  The regular, constant ghosts found to and fro the game are vanquished easily.  By screening the flashlight on a ghoul, a significant number of HP will appear, and the player must completely nullify that number.  Operating the Hoover, Luigi will be thrown left and right while the skirmishing ghost endeavors not to be sucked into oblivion.  Gradually, its HP will melt down, reaching 0 and finally being bagged.  Sounds very simple, no?  Well, soon the rules are altered as new, nastier, and more technique-employed ghosts come screeching down the halls.  If the player is stomped on how to thrash a certain ghost, simply utilizing the Game Boy Horror will force the phantom to discharge a hint on ripping them apart.  Other ghosts, intent on not letting the player see them, unveil themselves once Luigi carries out particular tasks.  Subsequently, Luigi goes face to face with immense bosses that require different tactics to slaughter.  On the dot, Luigi's Mansion keeps and repeats this gameplay pattern., not really making up for its abrupt conclusion and obvious repetitiveness.On the graphical standpoint, this is beyond what other previous consoles have come close to imitate.  Remembering when the PlayStation tried to encapsulate fitting cartoony looks, the GameCube scoffs at all preceding efforts, pulling off the greatest type of cartoon visuals ever.  Running at 30 frames per second, making use of spotless lighting, shadow, and transparency effects, Luigi's Mansion will have any kid ditch the teletubbies, and glue their faces onto the pulsating gaming screen.  Luigi has a original collection of facial expressions.  Moving gracefully, without any slowdown, the player and his surroundings are planed in a radiance of lightly colored backgrounds and an overwhelming number of illumination effects.  Just the little threads of detail in the game give a hint on how future GameCube titles will be furnished around dazzling tapestries.  As if to counter this pro, the musical soundtrack are rather lackluster and utterly uninspiring.  While the game's many sounds (Luigi humming to himself) and all the other jingles are up-to-the-par with quality, the redundant music recurs over and over and over. . .Even though my gaming hunger for the next Mario platform is months away (Mario Sunshine), Luigi's Mansion proves to be a wistful frolic until the ornate mind of Miyamoto breaks all the gaming rules yet again.  Lavishing some good innovation, save for the succinctness on the hours, the game is a demanding buy, but well worth a revisit on the all-star plumbers.

By this point, most gamers have tried the original "Donkey Kong".  While not quite as iconic as Pac-Man, "Donkey Kong" was effectively what put Nintendo on the map in the gaming industry, and the debut of a certain "Jump Man", who would later be renamed Mario.  You may have heard of him.  He went on to have a pretty successful career after this game.So what is "Donkey Kong"?  A giant ape who kidnaps Pauline (not Princess Peach), who Mario . . . er, Jump Man must rescue.  Donkey Kong throws barrels at Jump Man. Jump Man must avoid the barrels, jump over other obstacles, climb ladders, etc, to get to the top of the screen and save the princess from the throes of Bowser . . . er . . . Donkey Kong!What is notable about this game and other early pre-Famicom/NES titles was Nintendo was actually a third party.  Once upon a time, in the early 1980s they licensed their IPs to other platforms at the very start of their foray into video games. Given the troubled fortunes of the Wii U during its initial launch cycle, and Nintendo President Saturo Iwata's adamant refusal to license out its IPs to tablet/smart phone devices, playing Mario and Donkey Kong on anything other than Nintendo hardware just seems bizarre, and that's because no one has played their Ips on non-Nintendo hardware (at least, legally), in decades.One of my first experiences with Nintendo games was playing Donkey Kong and Mario Bros on the Atari 2600. In 1983 Nintendo and Atari were trying to broker a deal and when that fell thru they brought out the Famicom that year and the Pal/US equivalent (NES) in 1985. Before that though they did publish their games on the Atari and some other hardware.The Gameboy Advance title in the Classic NES series is, appropriately enough, the NES version of Donkey Kong.  The problem with the NES port is that it's only three levels, and is missing the fourth level that was exclusive to the arcade (which is the pie level).By now, years after its release and the Gameboy Advance long superceded by Nintendo's subsequent handhelds, there is very little appeal in picking up this edition of "Donkey Kong".  First, it's only three levels long and can literally be beaten in ten to twenty minutes, with the only appeal being to go for high scores (which was appropriate to the market in the early 1980s . . . but even by the late 1980s, people just didn't care about high scores).Overall, the Classic NES series was fairly disappointing.  With few exeptions (such as "The Legend of Zelda", "Zelda II: The Adventure of Link", and "Super Mario Bros."), Nintendo released (in America, anyway), mostly very short gameplay experiences.  The Japanese "Famicom Mini" series had a much stronger lineup than the games we got in the West.In terms of Donkey Kong, I would pick it up on the Virtual Console if you really want to play it.  Do not waste your money on the Gameboy Advance version.

Fans of the N64 wrestling game series waited long for a next-gen successor to take Nintendo to the next level of sports entertainement.  They will have to keep waiting.Wrestlemania X8 sports what feels very much like Smackdown,  but lacks many of the features the Smackdown series made it big for.  The Create a Wrestler (CAW) system,  while creating smooth wrestlers,  is very limited.  Here's a rundown:Graphics:  The graphics are great in some places,  but are inconsistant.  While some wreslters look very much like their counterparts,  many don't.  The movements onscreen are rather jerky and don't quite line up.  It's a step up from previous Nintendo platform games,  but nothing for a next gen system.Sound:  The only complaint I've come up with so far,  from myself or others is that the levels are a bit low.  If cranking your stereo or TV up a couple of notches is the only problem,  you're pretty much standing on solid ground.  The sound does indeed need some extra volume,  but is otherwise excellent.Controls:  The controls are clumsy and unintuitive.  While they're not impossible to manage,  many commands double for mulptiple things you might attempt to do in the same circumstances.  The instruction manual is horribly organized for attempting to find what buttons you hit to perform what.Gameplay:  Well,  this is what matters in a wrestling game.  Controls,  as mentioned above,  are unintuitive,  but responsive at the very least.  Timing seems less important in this game,  compared to other titles.The moveset is incredibly limited.  No Mercy had 16 different grapple moves per wrestler (Counting only front grapples for simplicity in this review),  Smackdown had ten,  WM X8 has 5. The selection of grapple options is pretty limited too.Pre-release hype pointed to slower,  more realistic gameplay,  and better &quot;selling&quot; of moves (Selling refers to taking the move and making it look good).  The gameplay is slower than the mindless funger numbing pound-any-button-and-win frenzy of smackdown,  but win strategies are still pretty limited.

Fans of the N64 wrestling game series waited long for a next-gen successor to take Nintendo to the next level of sports entertainement.  They will have to keep waiting.Wrestlemania X8 sports what feels very much like Smackdown,  but lacks many of the features the Smackdown series made it big for.  The Create a Wrestler (CAW) system,  while creating smooth wrestlers,  is very limited.  Here's a rundown:Graphics:  The graphics are great in some places,  but are inconsistant.  While some wreslters look very much like their counterparts,  many don't.  The movements onscreen are rather jerky and don't quite line up.  It's a step up from previous Nintendo platform games,  but nothing for a next gen system.Sound:  The only complaint I've come up with so far,  from myself or others is that the levels are a bit low.  If cranking your stereo or TV up a couple of notches is the only problem,  you're pretty much standing on solid ground.  The sound does indeed need some extra volume,  but is otherwise excellent.Controls:  The controls are clumsy and unintuitive.  While they're not impossible to manage,  many commands double for mulptiple things you might attempt to do in the same circumstances.  The instruction manual is horribly organized for attempting to find what buttons you hit to perform what.Gameplay:  Well,  this is what matters in a wrestling game.  Controls,  as mentioned above,  are unintuitive,  but responsive at the very least.  Timing seems less important in this game,  compared to other titles.The moveset is incredibly limited.  No Mercy had 16 different grapple moves per wrestler (Counting only front grapples for simplicity in this review),  Smackdown had ten,  WM X8 has 5. The selection of grapple options is pretty limited too.Pre-release hype pointed to slower,  more realistic gameplay,  and better &quot;selling&quot; of moves (Selling refers to taking the move and making it look good).  The gameplay is slower than the mindless funger numbing pound-any-button-and-win frenzy of smackdown,  but win strategies are still pretty limited.  As for the &quot;sell time,&quot;  expect your opponents to stay down only a little longer after a Twist of Fate or Stone Cold Stunner than if they had been nailed with an Eye rake or Fireman Carry.The grappling is also a holdover from Smackdown.

The year is 2002. President bush is plaining an invasion on Iraq because of threats of Nuclear weapons, America is entertained with American Idol. And the WWE just celebrated another Wrestlemania. In 2002 thq came out with this wrestling game. When I saw it I thought it was going to be one of the best wrestling games. But I was wrong. The controls are easy. But the game is bad. If your stone cold and you nail the stunner they get up right away. Just like on smackdown you can pop a finisher anytime. The Music is bad. And the story mode is god awful. If your champion you don't come out with the belt. My friends don't get Smackdown (err) I mean Wrestlemania X8 Get Day of reckoning. This game is very bad and should have never been created. Shame on you THQ For this game. Shame Shame Shame

As I stopped by my local Gamestop, I stumbled upon this bargin-bined game, F-Zero GX. I immediatley bought it as  it was slashed through a barrage of sale prices. I have to say though, this game is worth any price put upon.For those who are unfamilar with this game, F-Zero is what we call a "futuristic" racing game that takes no mercy. Begining the Grand Prix Mode beginners may pee in their pants because this game is not easy.The racers are pretty diverse, ranging from Samuaris to aliens to human beings, most of the racers are gone due to the fact that you have unlock them by winning the Grand Prix, which again as I said in the previous paragraph, can be hard at times.Although the backcover of the game claims to have "20 tracks" its pretty much the same  5-6 track but with nostalgic loops and hard turns.Now the difficulty of this game can lead beginners and moderate players bitting their controller. The AI in this game can be pretty cheap during segments of the races; while I was heading towards the end of the race I was in first place and I was on the home stretch, one narrow gap and I win! So I think. All of a sudden, 5 racers begin endeavoring to crowd already small gap and kill me off since I forget to mention there's an energy bar. Yes, for boosting and your way of "defending yourself."Overall this game is okay. veterans of this series and those stepping up to the plate will love the action, the nostalgia races, cool music and the challenge itself to be the best.

First off be careful where you get your used controller from. I got mine from Finest Play and from what I can tell, these controllers were all rebuilt fron parts of other controllers that were broken in one form or another. I got one controller that has the orange spice plug at the end instead of the silver plug and the other one had a black plug from the black controller. They are fine functionally but they were in worse condition than avertised. Used very good means that all parts on the contoller match and that they are free from major cosmetic damage. Thankfully I am good with the soldering iron and I got my controllers cord swapped for the spice cord and housing swapped for the one with the black end. Also while I was at it I cleaned all of the grime off of the controllers when I had them dissassembled.

Game & Wario, the latest entry in the very strange yet comparatively successful WarioWare series, aims to dethrone Nintendo Land as the Wii U party game of choice, but due to sloppy execution in both presentation and core gameplay mechanics across almost all of its 16 digitized vignettes, the end result is a pixelated manifestation of an opportunity ignored.  Game & Wario was initially conceived as a customary demonstrative package of some of the Wii U's snazziest features, and was at first planned to be preinstalled on its hard drive... much of it feels stylistically lazy and conceptually undercooked. Smooth development was hampered with apparent misdirection, stretched out and later unpunctually slapped with the Wario label, giving Intelligent Systems the excuse to go crazy with the content, as Wario-themed endeavors often rely on their off-the-wall tone and frenzied overture to attain the desired effect. Even if previous WarioWare efforts weren't all that visionary, they nonetheless managed to provide a significant amount of replay value that took quite awhile to begin the process of subsiding. Only a fraction of Game & Wario's 16 mini-games (12 single-player, 4 multiplayer-only), each spotlighting an anchor WarioWare character, are noteworthy, and the rest can be filed as fundamentally counterproductive attempts to find resourceful uses for the peripheral interplay between the screen of the Wii U's GamePad and your television set.Of the heavily imbalanced batch, "Gamer" implements the best usage of the Wii U's dual-panorama coaction, having players assume the role of avid Nintendo fanboy 9-Volt as he plays a number of 8-bit microgames on his treasured handheld under the covers. It's past the youngster's curfew, and his mother, 5-Volt, continually bursts into the bedroom, hollering at you to go to sleep. The goal is, naturally, to not get caught for as long as possible. The GamePad's display is host to a collection of diverting microgames, and the happenings in 9-Volt's room occur on the TV monitor. The exhibited synergy is utterly simplistic yet rather ingenious, sensibly and effectively leading your focal points astray while evoking nostalgia. (Seriously, what prepubescent gamer didn't spend late nights beneath blankets with their Game Boy?) The most durable WarioWare exploits, such as "Gamer," rack the brain, but do so in a way that's inexplicably addictive, stopping short of crossing the line into controller-breaking frustration. "Pirates" and "Taxi" are also examples of this kind of inspired cleverness: The former is a feverish rhythm game that uses the GamePad as a sort of shield to deflect incoming directional indicators ordered by a mad Captain Wario, while the latter has easily distracted dog-and-cat cabbies Dribble and Spitz starring in a kinetic drive down Route 56. "Taxi" is the less inventive of the two, having a first-person windshield perspective on the GamePad and a map on the TV screen, but it decidedly has the least amount of diminishing returns, repeatedly offering a high degree of dynamism even in its preliminary stages.While these three minigames are enjoyable, their inventiveness doesn't carry over to the remainder of Game & Wario. The worst offenders in the single-player bracket are chronically dull, requiring only a few minutes to master and hardly tapping into Wii U's brimming reserve of versatile functionality; their unimaginative names basically discloses all you need to know. In "Arrow" you shoot arrows, in "Bowling" you bowl, in "Design" you draw, in "Ski" you ski, and in "Shutter" you take pictures, nothing more. Trudging through each is snooze-worthy from the outset, and it doesn't help that Game & Wario's sights and sounds exude an overwhelming air of flash-cartoon shabbiness.In the multiplayer department, the only red-letter enterprise is "Fruit," an occasionally amusing whodunnit that has one player selecting a thief among a crowd of wandering citizens, periodically pulling off discreet apple swindlings, while the other players try to figure out who the culprit is. "Disco" is a dance game, but it lacks the finesse of the similarly-styled "Pirates," "Sketch" is essentially a low-rent rip-off of Pictionary, and "Islands" is perhaps the laziest addition to the compendium, a half-assed take on the darts/marbles/horseshoes dynamic where players launch blockish Fronks at spinning scoreboards, knocking opponents off as they go in a lifeless contest that eventually boils down to who can stay interested the longest. Not much is worse in a modern minigame collection than the bane of instant redundancy emboldened by substandard visuals, and Game & Wario, unfortunately, sinks to that level in its primitive phases and seldom makes a forceful effort to systematically compensate for its laundry list of weaknesses.Basically, the game is boring, short & lacking content, and isn't worth your time - let alone your money.  I would barely classify this as a rental.  This could have easily been a digital download or free demo given out by Nintendo, and it's a shame they have packaged this as a $40 "game."
If your goal in life is to play a deep RPG with superb gameplay, stunning music, lush visuals, and a compelling storyline, then you will not achieve it with Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door. If you want a game that will fill a little time with fun mechanics, passable parody, and occasional flashes of inspiration, this is the one for you.GAMEPLAY: ExcellentPaper Mario 2 utilizes a standard RPG model for gameplay; the party journeys through an overworld, dropping into combat when an enemy is encountered. Mario and one of his sidekicks appear onscreen at all times, and only one sidekick may accompany him in battle (though they may be swapped out at will). The combat takes place on a stage, with an audience; their reactions to your exploits will gain you "Star Power" which can be used to execute special moves.As with the original Mario games, Paper Mario relies heavily on timing. Moving through the overworld often requires you to precisely time jumps or movement. Additionally, effective combat depends on the player's ability to time "Action Commands" that enhance damage, Defense Actions that decrease damage, and "Stylish" moves that excite the audience and increase Star Power. Some of these action commands, and almost all of the special moves, are so intricate that they nearly qualify as minigames in and of themselves. Though this sounds like a lot of work, it also increases the fun by engaging the player in every moment of the combat turn (unlike RPGs where the success and power of the character's attacks are essentially out of the player's hands). On the downside, some of them are so frustratingly difficult to use or operationally opaque that you'll give up on them.Games that require precise timing also need precise controls so that you don't break your controller or TV by throwing one at the other. In this respect, Paper Mario delivers, providing a minimum of frustration. Also, the game is designed so that any control failures experienced do not result in anything more damaging than a loss of 1HP. The 2D 'paper' motif also means that the camera takes a fixed viewpoint at almost all times. This is occasionally annoying because Mario will sometimes be obscured by the scenery. Additionally, some enemies can strike you and attack from offscreen; the ability to zoom out to get a wider view would have been most welcome.Character growth for Mario depends on the acquisition of Star Points, which you get from defeating enemies. Unfortunately, as you get to higher levels, you'll almost never get more than one Star Point from any given battle, making improvement a long, tedious process. After you get 100, you'll increase a level, which allows you to increase your HP, FP (essentially mana), or Badge Points. Badges are special possessions that grant a special attack or ability, including changing Mario's appearance or the sound effects that accompany his attacks (this actually becomes important at one point). Some badges require more badge points than others, though this doesn't necessarily correlate with the usefulness of the badge. Power Smash, for instance, may be the best badge in the game (it heightens your attack and also enables several Stylish moves), and only requires 1 BP. Your sidekicks can be upgraded using Shine Sprites, which you generally acquire by ramming a floating box with Mario's head.Mario also uses his papery attributes to move through the overworld. Most of these were fun, though I didn't much like Mario's paper boat form, which I found to move awkwardly and be of limited use. Mario's partners have special skills too, and proper use of them will be essential in order to progress. The puzzles are generally easy to solve, however, and one of your sidekicks (Goombella) can give you hints as well.The only major hiccup in the gameplay comes from the inventory, which is too small. You will constantly be tossing away items that you want to pick up but can't because your inventory is full. You can store items for future use in the item shops, but because vendors are rarely found in the depths of dungeons this doesn't help much. Naturally, once your inventory starts running low, you'll encounter substantially fewer items to put in it. If you could carry 15 or 20 usable items instead of ten, this would probably have worked better. This is a minor complaint however, and causes only occasional frustration.There are a few minigames in cutscenes and the Pianta Parlor which are mildly diverting but not intrinsically worthwhile. You DO get to play as Bowser through several levels resembling (they may even actually be, it's been a long time) Super Mario World. This is both fun and hilarious.STORY: AverageAppropriately enough, the plot is paper-thin. Princess Peach has been kidnapped (surprise, surprise), and Mario must formulate some plan for rescuing her while gathering up Crystal Stars so he can unlock an ancient treasure (or maybe it's something else). So you go into various dungeons, beating various bosses, to collect the various stars, blah blah blah etc. In short, nothing too much different from the very first Mario game way back when. The various sidekicks and incidentals say and do so little that is not connected to the quest that there's no sense of character development at all. The dialogue is only rarely witty and very few of the planned jokes are funny (except for Bowser's stuff); the several instances where characters break the "fourth wall" uniformly fall flat.That said, there are a few examples of reasonably clever parody, and an inspired send-up of professional wrestling (Feel the Rawk!). Also, the "stage" for combat is an interesting way of deconstructing RPG gameplay while simultaneously embracing its roots. Though overall the story falls squarely on the lowest end of RPG expectations, the above factors make it interesting enough to warrant at least one play-through for gamers of any age.AUDIO: PoorThe music in the game did NOT make my ears fall off and writhe on the ground in agony, wailing about their pathetic, premature demise. However, the tinny, synthesizer-driven score grated on me at the best of times, and I often found myself reaching for the mute button on my remote. Granted, this approach fits in with the whole retro/2-D feel of the game, and the background music clearly mined older Mario games for inspiration. It is telling, however, that I sighed with real relief and enjoyment when the original Mario theme resurfaced in all its 8-bit glory. For all their efforts, the composers on this game produced nothing that was better, and much that was worse, than what we heard on the NES.There's no voice acting to speak of, save for a few isolated words and noises from Mario. However, almost all text appearances are accompanied by an annoying noise of some kind. Overall, this game is not an experience your ears will remember kindly.VISUALS: ExcellentGranted, if you come to this game looking for rich, textured backgrounds and nuanced character models, you will be sorely disappointed. However, within the confines of what they're trying to do, the artists almost uniformly succeed. Though flat in appearance, the backgrounds are nicely detailed and convincingly portray the desired environment, from the seedy main square of Rogueport to the aristocratic refinement of the Shadow Palace. The visual touches emphasizing the "paper" motif all work very well. Some of the enemies, particularly Magnus von Grapple and Hooktail, have "folded paper" designs that look fantastic; on the downside, it appears that the game designers liked both of these so much they had to use them twice. Lack of variety among the other monsters is also a negative visual note... There are very few actual designs; most monsters are variations of earlier ones, just painted a different color, or having spikes or wings.The only really poor visual effect was the pigs in Chapter 4. Bizarrely, these were rendered in crude 3-D, an approach that added nothing and broke up the visual motif. These would have been much better if inserted with the same heavy-lined ink-drawing approach as everything else.REPLAYABILITY: MediocreOne advantage of this game is that you never really leave anything behind. Virtually any area can be revisited after it is ostensibly completed, allowing you to pick up every item on your first playthrough. The disadvantage to this is that there is nearly nothing to do when you play the game over. Because the game lacks an engaging story, and none of the cutscenes are scripted well enough to demand being revisited (except perhaps Bowser's replays of Super Mario World), there's really no reason to ever play it a second time.OVERALL: Worthwhile (68%)Mature gamers with an appreciation for deep RPGs will find Paper Mario a trifle, easily breezed through, easily discarded, and appreciated mainly because of nostalgia. The gameplay is engaging and occasionally demanding, but never terribly difficult, and has been paired with charming graphics. I recommend this game primarily for younger gamers (which is, after all, Nintendo's core audience). The plot is devoid of overt sexual references, and almost all romance is played for laughs. Like most RPGs, this has some violence, but since combat mostly revolves around a man jumping on turtles and whacking them with a giant mallet, it's unlikely to upset most parents. There are better titles on the market for teens and adults, but for children under 13 or so this is a worthy introduction to RPGs that offers little (besides the music) that will offend their caregiving adults.

My problem with Conker doesn't have as much to do with the idea so much as it does the follow-through. In all honesty, I was thrilled to hear the company had recognized their own flaws and were attempting to reconcile for them by releasing a shockingly robust title that seemed to spit in the face of everything they'd done since the debates caused by the home release of the original Mortal Kombat. However, I left my initial playing with the sense that the while idea itself was exactly what the company needed, the execution was more than a tad lacking.The story plays out like a theatrical feature, which is appropriate considering the number of situations the game eventually borrows from popular films. Glass of milk (or is it a white russian?) in hand and a scowl plastered upon his face, Conker is immediately reminiscent of the kind of anti-hero popularized by Bruce Willis in Die Hard or Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction. Surrounded by his supposed friends and acquaintances, this introductory scene was a great way to set the tone of the story and introduce a hardened, slightly older version of the title's namesake. The moment the king's flashback begins is when the player begins to take control of the action.There's a lot of Hollywood inspiration in Conker's tale. From the little nuances and cliches such as the opening scene, to borrowed scenes or tips of the hat to films like the location of the King's throne at the end of the game, to straightforward rip-offs of memorable scenes or films like the unquestionably Matrix bank heist, this cartridge is chock full of film-lore. And, to its credit, the vast majority of the game's quirks, nods and thefts are handled very well, with just enough originality and additional humor thrown in to make it work within the broad confines of its storyline.For the most part, the story is successful. Its film parodies are spot on, while its original threads tend to lag behind a bit and force a joke just for the sake of it. It feels like the game was rushed, and rather than waiting for the inspiration to create something undeniably funny, the writers instead went with whatever they came up with the fastest. In addition, there's little if any direction as to what you should be doing at any point in the story. Bad Fur Day is a big fan of putting you in the middle of an immense area with no visual clues as to where you should go from there, then erecting giant invisible walls out of thin air and hoping that their placement will corral you into the exact area in which you should be. Successful or not, this method is employed over and over and over again, from the game's start until its finish.While the storyline is competent for the most part, the actual control and gameplay itself is nearly unforgivable. Physically controlling Conker is a complete nightmare. Even the use of the N64's well-designed analog joystick can't save this horribly imprecise setup, as the squirrel will occasionally veer left or right without explanation or mosey over the edge of a cliff moments after you've told him to stop moving entirely. Conker does have a sort of double-jump feature, in that through the use of his tail he can hover in the air for a couple additional seconds. He can also perform a high jump and a long jump, by crouching or running for a few second before leaping, accordingly. Unfortunately, these high jump and long jump options only seem to work when they feel like it. I've been running for upwards of a full minute, jumped, and watched Conker perform a weak little sissy jump and fall to his doom. This game really feels like something that wasn't fully tested before its release, the controls reek of incompletion.Add onto that one of the most horrific cameras in the history of 3-D rendering, and you've already got a pissed off gamer. Seriously, you're given supposed control of these angles through the use of the C buttons (similar to the way the camera is maneuvered in The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time), but as soon as you find a vantage point you're comfortable with and release the C button, it just goes off on its own and returns to a completely unhelpful, useless view. This camera cannot pass through walls, so if your back is against one and you're trying to prepare for a complicated, lengthy, precise leap, you've got to do it blind. Better still, once you've made up your mind and attempted said jump, the camera will awkwardly spin as soon as it's got room to get behind you, effectively reversing your controls in mid-air and introducing a loss of direction to your life.The audio is one of the few undeniable triumphs of this one. The voice acting is tremendous, Conker's voice suits him perfectly and the actors themselves seem to be having a lot of fun with the material. The music is the usual fare for Rare platformers, light and bouncy, and serves as a constant joke considering the circumstances surrounding it. Little tidbits like the main character mumbling to himself and retching when he's drunk, or fighting back bile while rolling an enormous ball of poo really make a difference in the experience, and are things I wish more games took the time to incorporate.When push comes to shove, there's really only one thing you can create with the ingredients provided by Conker's Bad Fur Day, and that's disappointment. There's no question in my mind this game needed another couple months of production before it was ready to ship, and looking back it should be regarded as the poster boy for the N64's lifespan. This game wasn't created to entertain and enamor so much as it was to annoy, frustrate and defeat.

Mario Kart won't survive another videogame generation if Nintendo waits another 7 years to make a sequel. Famously, at E3 when they were still introducing the gamecube, Nintendo showed charts displaying how game sequels were just perpetuating old ideas, like anyone minds. The big N's idea for the GC Mario Kart was to give them two riders. The difficulty on 50cc is pathetic, you'll never see another kart for the length of the laps. 150cc is challenging but the placement is random determined by whether you get hit by a spiked shell in 1st or not on the last race. Multi-player is bland, no one is going to hook up two tvs, two gamecubes and two mario kart discs. The multi-maps are simple and limited to one level.I would have enjoyed seeing some obstacle courses where you dodge bananas, etc. all through the lap. Also, many other tracks are too plain. DK Mountain is probably the best of them.

To say the least, Donkey Kong took everything this genre stood for, and made a muck-up of it. Endless item collecting, muddy details and slow action leave this one for the chimps, uh, chumps.You have bananas, golden and coloured, coins, coconuts, ammo, musical notes etc. and for five characters. The collecting seems endless, and when i was forty % done the game, i just stopped. I looked at this forest level and i said, this looks just like the desert and water ones, only with a different backdrop.And what's with the story? Some giant floating island or something? Why does K Rool have such a loathing for the Kongs? WHy doesn't he just butcher them instead of placing them in unguarded, easily escapable places???? Rare really messed up on this one. The sound isn't all that awesome (the DK rap, what the heck was that?), and the graphics were bleh; this thing required the 4mb expansion? Banjo Kazooie looked twice as good.Even the characters are lame. I thought the release of Kiddy Kong in DKC3 was dumb, but now we have three new characters that couldve easily been replaced by 2 old ones. Tiny is the spitting image of Dixie, and Lanky is the babyish side of Kiddy while Chunky is, well the chunky side.I think Rare thought their game was weak themselves, that must be why they added this mediocre 3rd person shooter multiplayer, isn't it? They didn't think they did a good job on the shooter part did they?I have so many peeves about this game, it's nuts. What difference is tehre between the gun and the instrument??? They both unlock things. Why did Rare feel it necessary to have two things that can work switches??Honestly, the only entertaining and redeeming part of this game are the Jetpac and Donkey Kong hidden arcade games.Certainly a long game, but length is not always a good thing. Look at Conker's BFD, it was short, and still owned this game wicked bad. 15 hours of this, and you'll wish Rare had stopped there.

There were so many things that could have been done with this game but wasn't. As John Raimi you are part of a team sent in to retrieve Bryson, your friend and undercover operative at the Volks corporation. Unfortunately for you the team gets annihilated, Bryson is captured and you get your spirit seperated from your body. While your spirit is being brain washed to become an operative you are rescued by the spirit of a little girl, Gigi. You now have to rescue Bryson, bring down the Volks corporation, and get your body back.There is both first person shooter action in this game and puzzle solving. You can possess people, animals, and inanimate objects. The whole possession capability is made into a puzzle solving strategy because in order to possess living things like a man, dog, or even a rat it has to be scared first. So for example, in order to possess the scientist you need to first possess the soda machine, shoot some cans out at him, possess the soda can and make it explode in his face, and then to really scare him make the water in the sink turn into blood. Some of these were funny but some were tedious.Possession was also helpful in combat. For example, you could possess the explosive crate a enemy just happened to be standing next to and well you know.... Some of the boss fights utilized the possession capability very well making them interesting while others did not.When you possess someone they each have a special capability. But there was nothing special about most of these capabilities. For example, the special capability for most chracters was that they could sprint. It would have been nice if say the doctor's special capability was that she could heal herself.The first person shooting capabilities were also annoying. Most soldiers can throw grenades but they can't crouch or jump!There are parts in the game where you are in the brain washing chamber. You are being trained to be an operative who will possess hosts in order to carry out assasinations etc When I was playing the operative training levels I thought to myself "why isn't the whole game like this!"The game's concept is original for the most part but when the strange creatures came pouring in through the whole to another dimension.....I thought I was playing Half-Life. Actually, the whole possession thing kinda made me think of the mind controlling in Second Sight...which was a rip off of Psi-Ops.....Anyway this game failed to live up to its potential.Its a $20 game NOT A PENNY MORE, it probably won't take you long to beat it so do not spend alot of money on this game. But when you finish playing story mode you can play multiplayer modes. You unlock arenas for multiplayer by collecting host collectibles during story mode. If you really want to play something excellent then play Psi Ops.

I must admit that while Dr. Mario's medical background is shady and unoriginal, his procedural methods can be fun. It's a love or hate affair. Those who've never had an appointment with the doctor may take to it, but others who in the past made regular visits might feel that he hasn't kept up with the times.Mario - I'm onto you. Think you can run around playing doctor while hocking your sugar pills? You might be offering your services for a seemingly affordable $29.95, but didn't we already try this medicine? Better get Lawyer Luigi on the phone.

What's so legendary about being a helpless princess who keeps having to be rescued? Anyway -- seeing as how my first review of this game was little or no help at all, I'm going to try again.Once again, you play as a young adventurer named Link or whatever name you give him. You're out on a quest to find your little sister, Aryl, after she is abducted by a dragon/bird. The controls are almost identical to The Ocarina of Time:A=ActionB=AttackX=Item 3Y=Item 1Z=Item 2L=Strafe/TargetR=BlockC=CameraControl-Stick=MovementCrossPad=um...map, I thinkThose are the ground controls. The controls for your raft are similar.Being a self-proclaimed feminist, I have trouble with the sexism involved in the story: Link is only trained by the elders because he is male, the same gender as the "legendary hero" from the Ocarina of Time. If you're not stung by political falacies, this probably won't bother you as much as it does me....moving on...Wind Waker recieves only 3 stars because it's essentially a rehash of Ocarina of Time with new graphics and a slightly different story. I don't really see any point in owning this title unless you are a die-hard Zelda fan. If you're more into Zelda herself, try Super Smash Bros Melee or some of those CD-i video games.

This game is boring. You can onlty expoler Hoen and there's not a lot of Pokemon form the other games. You can't connect to the other games and after the elite foure thres nothing for you to do except cath all the pokemon. You can't even travel to fight people in Jhoto and Kanto. Thats why I liked Gold and Sliver but this is stupid. You still have to make due with only Four moves not six or five, but only four moves. and some of the new pokemon is ugly and even some look alike. Also in the Pelterbug forrest cath two Slakouth because you can trade one for a pokemon I can't pronounce in Peltaburg city. In Peltaburg city you have to fight roxanne. She has a Lv. 15 Geodude and LV.14 Nosepass. Nosepass uses a attacked call Rock to mp it reduces your ablie and doese Damage!!! Use berries if you have them. If you have Treecko there is a guy in route 104 that gives a TM called Bullet Seed. teach that TM to Treecko. Bullet Seed is a Grass move that attacks 2 -5 times. It doese crital damage to Rock and fighting pokemon. If you don't have Treccko, another good poke for the gym leader is Dustox. Level up a wrumple to lv.10 and learn confusion. and Gust at lv.13. At slateport, if you defeat all the trainers in the shack you get six Sodapop!!!

I feel sad for Geist, I really do. It's not that it's a bad game, it's actually pretty good. But it could have been so much MORE. Maybe it needed more time in development, maybe it needed a better team. For whatever reason, Geist's potential is clear to see, and while it remains satisfying, it just doesn't live up to it.STORY: Not horrible. You're John Raimi, and you're having a really bad day. First you get sent in to rescue a friend from an evil corporation and maybe help save the world from its supposed bioweapon. Things go wrong, and you find yourself strapped to a huge machine that splits your spirit from your body. Apparently making ghosts by driving your victims into a frenzy of hate and killing them has gone out of fashion. Guided by a VERY CREEPY little girl ghost named Gigi, you have to figure out what in the world's going on and maybe, you know, get your body back and escape at some point.Volks, the evil corporation, is pretty much your stereotypical evil corporation meddling with powers that none of them are smart enough to fully comprehend. If I were running a corporation which dealt with ghosts, even only occasionally, I would arm my guards with spirit-detecting equipment and effective weapons.  You know how they detect ghosts at Volks?With dogs.Dogs that can be possessed.GAMEPLAY: All right! Where to start?Geist kind of feels like a quirky mixture between various FPS's. You've got the dorky scientist protagonist (Half-Life) who's friends with a seemingly unkillable black guy (Halo 2) and sneaks around a giant research facility trying to remain undetected (Metal Gear Solid. Yes, I know that's not an FPS) and fights evil soldiers and demons (Doom.)Naturally, one of the most outstanding features of the game is the fact that you're a disembodied spirit. This means that you can't directly interact with the physical world most of the time. Most people can't see you (though you appear a rather vivid electric blue to yourself) and you can walk (er, float) right through them. What you can do is possess things. Objects are free for possession, and you can make them do unnatural things. You don't get a lot of choice as to what you make the object do, but it's still fun. My favorite one is messing with the cells under a microscope so they spell out DIE. Freaks scientists out like nothing else. Once you've used these abilities to scare the living daylights out of a creature, you can possess that creature. There's something very entertaining about frightening these poor virtual saps who have no idea what's going on.Animal hosts can typically go places humans can't, while humans have one weapon (if any) and a special action (like running or crouching) apiece. Some hosts are expendable, you can let them die and move on to another, others must be kept from dying (fortunately, health packs are plentiful.)  While each host has only a single weapon (sometimes with a secondary feature,) there's a fair amount of variety among hosts. Some weapons are the best you can find (ratchet gun,) other are ordinary (assault rifle.) More exotic guns do eventually appear: spirit-hunter guns and weapons made from materials most.... unorthodox.The game has a noteable horror overtone (made ironic by the fact that the most prominent ghost is you, but I mean besides hauntings caused by the player.). The creepy old house you wander through at one point is spooky in a very classical way.While there is a lot of stuff you can possess, I think the game would have been vastly improved if it gave greater freedom over what is possessable and allowed you to improvise your own ways to scare things.One point of major lameness: When fighting a boss monster, the life-bar at the top of the screen almost invariably reads "Creature" or "Boss" rather than giving it a name. When you do find out the names of creatures, they're always something trite like "imp" or "hydra," or worst of all "tentacle monster." The names don't even fit the monsters particularly well (Geist's hydras have only one head each.)VIOLENCE: MildWhile you will end up wiping out a significant percentage of  Volks Corps. Employees, the violence in this game is not particularly harsh or graphic (with one exception towards the beginning.) Enemies just die, sometimes with an amusing line like "Aw, crap!" There's a lot of focus on sneaking around and remaining undetected, either as an invisible ghost or making your host body act "natural". You CAN usually wipe out everybody you see, but it's generally not a good idea. It's still not a game I'd give to an eight-year-old.The "partial nudity" mentioned on the box is deserved; you do sneak into the womens' shower at one point, though towels and convenient bubbles guard the occupants from ethereal voyeurism. Not that the women are especially attractive polygons, see below.GRAPHICS: Eww! The graphics would have been impressive maybe two or three years ago. It's just sad that they couldn't do better than these flat-faced avatars whose mouths don't move except in cutscenes. The most impressive images in the game are likely the final boss (very pretty) and Raimi himself, who's really very blue for being invisible.MUSIC: Eh. Whatever.MULTIPLAYER: Weird. That can be good or bad. They're a bit slower paced than most other FPS multiplayer modes. You've got Host Deathmatch (where you swap bodies instead of getting new guns,) Capture the Host (steal a host and take it to base) and Sprit Hunting (Ghost Vs. Host, the host shoots the ghost with a special and extremely slow gun while the ghost tries to lead the host into a trap.) Some will like it, but I don't think most folks will.VERDICT: Geist is all right. It could seriously use a makeover, touch up the graphics, better the music, focus the gameplay more on possession and doing strange things with objects (even if they're useless.) If you can find it fairly cheap and are willing to try something new, give it a shot. If you want another cookie-cutter style just-kill-everything shooter, look someplace else.

There's something very entertaining about frightening these poor virtual saps who have no idea what's going on.Animal hosts can typically go places humans can't, while humans have one weapon (if any) and a special action (like running or crouching) apiece. Some hosts are expendable, you can let them die and move on to another, others must be kept from dying (fortunately, health packs are plentiful.)  While each host has only a single weapon (sometimes with a secondary feature,) there's a fair amount of variety among hosts. Some weapons are the best you can find (ratchet gun,) other are ordinary (assault rifle.) More exotic guns do eventually appear: spirit-hunter guns and weapons made from materials most.... unorthodox.The game has a noteable horror overtone (made ironic by the fact that the most prominent ghost is you, but I mean besides hauntings caused by the player.). The creepy old house you wander through at one point is spooky in a very classical way.While there is a lot of stuff you can possess, I think the game would have been vastly improved if it gave greater freedom over what is possessable and allowed you to improvise your own ways to scare things.One point of major lameness: When fighting a boss monster, the life-bar at the top of the screen almost invariably reads "Creature" or "Boss" rather than giving it a name. When you do find out the names of creatures, they're always something trite like "imp" or "hydra," or worst of all "tentacle monster." The names don't even fit the monsters particularly well (Geist's hydras have only one head each.)VIOLENCE: MildWhile you will end up wiping out a significant percentage of  Volks Corps. Employees, the violence in this game is not particularly harsh or graphic (with one exception towards the beginning.) Enemies just die, sometimes with an amusing line like "Aw, crap!" There's a lot of focus on sneaking around and remaining undetected, either as an invisible ghost or making your host body act "natural". You CAN usually wipe out everybody you see, but it's generally not a good idea. It's still not a game I'd give to an eight-year-old.The "partial nudity" mentioned on the box is deserved; you do sneak into the womens' shower at one point, though towels and convenient bubbles guard the occupants from ethereal voyeurism. Not that the women are especially attractive polygons, see below.GRAPHICS: Eww! The graphics would have been impressive maybe two or three years ago. It's just sad that they couldn't do better than these flat-faced avatars whose mouths don't move except in cutscenes. The most impressive images in the game are likely the final boss (very pretty) and Raimi himself, who's really very blue for being invisible.MUSIC: Eh. Whatever.MULTIPLAYER: Weird. That can be good or bad. They're a bit slower paced than most other FPS multiplayer modes. You've got Host Deathmatch (where you swap bodies instead of getting new guns,) Capture the Host (steal a host and take it to base) and Sprit Hunting (Ghost Vs. Host, the host shoots the ghost with a special and extremely slow gun while the ghost tries to lead the host into a trap.) Some will like it, but I don't think most folks will.VERDICT: Geist is all right. It could seriously use a makeover, touch up the graphics, better the music, focus the gameplay more on possession and doing strange things with objects (even if they're useless.) If you can find it fairly cheap and are willing to try something new, give it a shot. If you want another cookie-cutter style just-kill-everything shooter, look someplace else.
This is the so called &quot;Better version&quot; of pokemon blue and Red. The only thing that's better is that you can get Charmander , Squitle , and bulbasaur. the graphics chanmged a little bit and Pikachu is the only pokemon that cries it's name!!! Why is that? But Pikachu learns new atyttacks like: Dulble team at Lv.15. It raises your Envade. Slam at Lv 20 . A normal phsical attack . and Thunderbolt at Lv.26. Pikachu is your starting pokemon. But It can't evovle. Raichu like kicks ass. Raichu has one attack Pikachu doesn't, Mega Punch. for people that don't know this but sometimes you nmeed to make some of your pokemon to elvove to mlearn new moves.

If you want to see cute cartoon animals acting just like Beavis & ButtHead,then look no further than this disaster of a game.Once a lovable squirrel that fought acorns,poor Conker has been turned into a furry Beavis(or furry ButtHead)and generally staggers through the game,accomplishing absolutely NOTHING.And that's just how you feel when you try to play this piece of garbage-you'll constantly feel that you're not getting anywhere and that you're not accomplishing a single thing.In the game,all you do is get drunk,swear,stagger around,puke and have a hangover-all through the entire game.You'll start to feel like you're in the animal version of Beavis & ButtHead(remember how much Beavis & ButtHead love to swear,do drugs and get drunk?),and you'll start to wonder where the fun and enjoyment is.Unlike "Conker's Pocket Tales",there are no goals to accomplish,there is no plot,and there is absolutely NOTHING to do except swear,get drunk,puke and have a hangover.Despite how much people try to get you to believe that "Conker's Bad Fur Day" is the greatest game around,you'll learn the truth about this game:That it's just a big promotion for alcohol.Do yourselvwes a favor and get "Conker's Pocket Tales" instead.If you want a REAL M-rated game,then get Grand Theft Auto.

All the humor is this game might be amusing if not for the gawd-awful controls. Even after Conker sobers up, he still acts like he's drunk -- just like the developers. Thanks a lot, Rare!! You ruined my life!!Seriously though, I don't remember the controls being this bad, so maybe my controller's busted.The game opens with a tribute to Wendy Carlos' Clockwork Orange theme song and Conker sitting in a throne, about to explain how he became king of the land. "It was a bad fur day."  Next thing you know, Conker's in a bar leaving a message on Berri's answering machine. Berri is the grey chipmunk on the right side of the cover in the pink two-piece. The control-response starts out really bad because Conker is drunk stupid. Then things clear up a bit after he talks to a marijuana plant. From there on, things just seem to get weirder. Rare wanted to make a fairy tale parody with sick humor, and that's exactly what they did.

Majora's Mask stands above all other Aonuma Zelda offerings as Eiji Aonuma's magnum opus of horribleness.Meaning if you ever doubted for just a moment that Eiji Aonuma was a horrible videogame director/creator/producer THIS is the game that should change your mind about that.Majora's Mask's game world and design utterly radiates Aonuma's total lack of charisma and incompetence throughout.From the goofy stupid moon above (which Aonuma/Nintendo fan lemmings constantly scream is "OMG MATURE AND DARK!!111!!") to the obnoxiously nasty remixed music of The Legend Of  Zelda: A Link To The Past's overworld theme this Aonuma Zelda offering, (the first of far too many) began the viscious cycle of Aonuma becoming the turd in The Legend Of Zelda's proverbial punch bowl and thus the Zelda series began it's steep decline in sales as it slides down Aonuma's creativity colon into the commode known as the bomba bin, where it then is flushed and deposited in the septic sewer of unsustainability.This game is the penultimate game for non entities and Aonuma's fellow traveller charisma deficients to cling on to and claim is oh so great in a pathetic attempt to make themselves look artsy, edgy and cultured as a result because *wink wink* reader, they know something about Majora's Mask that WE don't know...or so their asperger's syndrome/autism addled minds makes them think.Yes indeed followers, lemmings and mental defectives are Majora's Masks main audience ie hipsters, liberal geldings, guys who get barb wire tattoos on their biceps because they think it makes them look tough etc. THOSE are the kind of weirdos that are drawn to defending Majora's Mask on gaming forums and making it out like it is the second coming when all it is in reality is Eiji Aonuma's second attempt at playing game designer.Well his first attempt with "Marvelous" failed abysmally and his constant inability to learn his lesson (and quit while he's ahead) has unsurprisingly resulted in another sales bomb for him with this trash known as Majora's Mask which I am reviewing for you Amazon's game customers now.The internet lames petition to have Majora's Mask made into a 3DS game has predictably and utterly (not to mention gloriously) failed because Nintendo knows what I know and that is Majora's Mask was a dud when it originally launched thus its not like its suddenly going to light the world on fire if it's re-released now.Oh the Nintendo fan lemmings and Nintendo damage controllists continually make their excuses for why the game failed ie they'll say that it failed because it was released at the end of the Nintendo 64's lifespan and required an add on to work, etc.Yet the truth of the matter is the game failed because it was a different game altogether than a Legend Of Zelda game.It was a completely different game that simply featured Link, the setting was uninspiring and the NPC's were bad as is typical of Aonuma Zelda games.The Nintendo fanboy excuses for why Majora's Mask failed don't hold water because a truly epic game, a game that creates a phenomenon like the original Super Mario Brothers, Halo or Ocarina Of Time for example...it wouldn't matter if such games were released at the end of a console's lifespan, or if they needed an add on or both, fans would move both heaven and earth to secure their copy and get whatever add on they needed to be able to play it.Thats the kind of motivating power true gaming phenomenon's possess and Majora's Mask just didn't have it because it wasn't the game the true Zelda fanbase were looking for at the time which was a true genuine sequel to Ocarina Of Time.People argue and even Nintendo says that Majora's Mask was a sequel to Ocarina Of Time as it used child Link from Ocarina Of Time but these damage controllists and Nintendo simply do not get it, get what people wanted out of a sequel to a game like Ocarina Of Time.We wanted a game that continued the sandbox/open world exploration of Hyrule and it's themes and lore, a non linear game world featuring Hyrule's forests, fields and rivers, lakes and lost woods, Ganon, Zelda, Gorons and the whole nine yards of what the true Zelda experience entails, just even more epic than Ocarina Of Time's experience was due to the idea that Nintendo would learn something about creating midieval sword and sorcery fantasy adventure epics that feel so good to play they are damn near like having a religious experience and we'd think they'd of learned as much from having made Ocarina Of Time, Link To The Past and even the very first Zelda game on the NES but NOOOOO!!!!Nintendo had to put Aonuma in charge of Zelda instead of who they should have that being Kozuimi and because of that this effeminate geek/dweeb non entity hack Jimmy Fallon of Japan, pretentious, egg headed, left brained high IQ beta male whose never gone on an adventure or taken any big risks in life who can't identify with regular everyday normal people has just got to prove his worth and show us just how "creative" he can be by using the Legend Of Zelda IP to vomit out his second modern art/art house flop disaster Major Embarassment...oops I meant Majora's Mask...(or did I?)And the result just like his first game "Marvelous" was a sales flop.NO SURPRISE THERE!Anyway Ocarina Of Time fans wanted Nintendo to take things to the next level instead of giving us garbage like the world of Termina and it's boring circular field and its incredibly boring and lame Clock town and a boring goofy looking totally non threatening moon overhead and a closet homosexual manchild named Tingle to mock true Zelda fans with as Kojima mocked Metal Gear Solid fans in a similar but far less offensive way with Raiden.Nintendo please for sanity's sake fire this guy already or if you can't bring yourself to firing Eiji Aonuma at least switch his role in the company to something that'd be more befitting his skill-set which in other words means he should be cleaning the corporate toilets or bringing donuts and coffee to people, if not rice and octupus (whatever corporate types in Japan prefer for breakfast).
