realmente ha cumplido el objetivo , me parecio que esta muy practico para pasar un buen rato de descanso. lo malo es que es lenta la lectura del juego y se pierde mucho tiempo en esa espera.

Great game and everything I've come to expect from a good RTS...with one problem.  Everytime you're attacked off screen, a trumpet call sounds.  It almost sounds like you're getting a text message.  Well this game is basically one big battle, so the trumpet call goes off about once every five or six seconds on average.  Now imagine a level that takes you forty minutes to complete.  The ENTIRE time you're playing its playing what sounds like the first four notes of the FFVII victory tune.  Bah bah bah bah....bah bah bah bah.....bah bah bah bah..."Sir we need re enforcements on...bah bah bah bah....the main gate"....bah bah bah bah....bah bah bah bah......bah bah bah bah....."get those archers on...bah bah bah bah.....those tower units"  bah bah bah bah.  I uninstalled the game after about ten minutes because there's no way to turn this feature off unless you turn off all sound.

Okay. This was just a nightmare of a gaming experience. Just, unbeliavably terrible. Just downright horrible. To be completely honest, this wouldn't be a bad game for ten years ago. Or maybe for 2001 or 2002, as a late N64 or PS1 title. But considering this game is pretty recent,it's downright inexcusable. So why is this game so bad. Well, to sum it up, it's EXTREMELY hard, to the point of frustrating. Not to mention randomly spawning enemies. That's right. Randomly Spawning Enemies, like the kind you'd find in a Nintendo Mega Man game where as soon as you take your camera view off the screen, more enemies show up. And what reward do you get for killing off all the enemies in the vincinity? Why, even MORE enemies! "A hit squad has been dispatched to take you out." Add this on top of a game that has really no direction, no storyline, or even point to it, and there's not even any reason to play it. It ain't fun, by any definition of the word.Basically, you're a genetically made SuperSoldier who is created by "The Agency," all of the nation's law enforcement combined into one agency, and you're told by some annoying old disembodied Commander voice -who also serves as the game's narrator and the only actual "character" in the entire game- to wipe out three criminal empires. And off you go shooting, to kill literally hundreds of thousands of enemies by the time you finish the game, if you can even bare it that long. ALL you do in this game is basically kill bad guys and jump from rooftops, and while the latter may sound fun in a Spider-Man sort of way, it really isn't. At least Spider-Man has webbing to control where he wants to go. You know, flying would be a whole lot simplier. And easier. Oh yeah. The game also has some very poorly conceived races. Either a rooftop race, which are usually extremely hard to beat in time, or some insanely stupid driving race, which if trying to drive isn't hard enough for you, trying to complete a Time Trials race in the wrong lane will surely push you over the edge.When you start, all of your skills - Agility for leaping, Driving for absolutely nothing, Explosives for bombing, Strength mostly just for health, and Firearms for shooting- are all poor and barely usable. And after you've leveled up all of them as you go along in the game, well... they're still extremely poor. The only thing that increases is the leaping ability, in which you can go from 10 to 30 feet in leaping height. The sprinting speed sure don't increase like they say it does, that's for sure.Driving, is more or less, utterly pointless in this game. 95% of the time, you'll never be in a car! Which is good for two reasons because, for one, Driving controls are really really retarded. Both in setup and manuevering. That's how bad it is. Bad in the "it's almost impossible to not run into civilians" sort of way, even when your driving skill is near maxed out. Why they would even bother with a Driving skill, when the only time you'll ever even drive is to either do the stupid races, or mainly, to travel really far distances on the islands, is beyond me. But the other reason you won't be in a car much, is not to hear the insansely bad soundtrack for the game. According to the in-game "Jukebox," there are over 100 songs in this game, and all of them are really bad, third party techno tracks. Like the soundtrack came out of the skeeziest clubs in Europe. The game IS partially European, at least, which is why things are referred to in the game as a "centre" or a "lift." It's odd considering that the game takes place in the near-future West Coast America and that other things like measurements (pounds, height in feet and inches, miles per hour) are North American standard, and not Metric. Anyway, the soundtrack is really European, really Techno, and really, really bad. Maybe they figured Techno music is "futuristic?" It doesn't matter anyway, because they could've saved some money by not getting all of these crap songs (which you can't cut off, by the way) for the car that you'll rarely be using, anyway. At least it's nice that the car tells you how many miles per hour you're driving, though, as you accidently plow into an idiot civilian.Strength is another almost utterly useless attribute. It's only effectiveness is raising your health. But to level it up, you'll have to beat down on enemies using melee attacks, which is even more rarely used than a vehicle. 99.9% of the game is shooting, and you can only really raise your strength (health) by whacking an enemy with a gun, or kicking them, which does very little damage to them, anyway. You see, some of your skills are raised per usage. Meaning, the more you shoot, the more you blow stuff up, and the more you win races, the higher your stats will go, with 400 points being the maximum effectiveness level (even though the bar will continue to go up to 500.) But you'll almost never kick or hit an enemy, so raising this stat is pretty annoying.The other way you raise stats is by collecting a bunch of stupid orbs. Literally hundreds of orbs, scattered across literally every rooftop in the game, is how you increase your Agility. You don't have to collect all 500 of them to max out your Agility though, because of the rooftop races (although you really won't win those much) and the blue, "Hidden orbs" which increase a little of every stat. In fact, those were the only way I was able to get Driving and Strength skills up. The driving is bad, no matter what, though, and the Strength, although lets you lift and carry objects weighing tons, is only useful for health. I had about 300/500 Agility orbs and 100/300 Hidden orbs, by the time I finished the game, and only Driving was lower than Level 2 (300 to 399 points).The shooting in this game, though, is severely flawed. And not because of the weak Firearms skills and weak firearms in the game. But by the Auto-Aim targeting being severely broken. I swear, this auto-aiming NEVER EVER EVER works the way you want it to. It sems to target only the most furthest enemies, or moving non-enemies first, and ONLY focuses on the guy right in your face when there's absolutely nothing left to kill. While the game does give you manual shooting as well, it's pretty hard to kill anything that's not close up to you with it. But the broken aiming and an invisible enemy grenade that you'll never even see until you're already dead are the two biggest things that'll kill you the most with this game. And unless you really get into this crapfest of a game, you will die hundreds upon hundreds of times. I only had it on normal difficulity, and I died like 30 times within any given hour.All the guns are pretty weak, and when I found it, about late into the first gang and location, I wound up using the Harrington HMG 90 rifle throughout the remainder of the game. You only get two weapons to hold at a time throughout the entire game, by the way. The problem with all of the serious firearms is that they're power is compensated by an extremely low clip or insanely slow reload times, with the Harrington being the slowest. I counted the reload time of this thing. Six seconds. Now picture that. In the heat of warfare, having to spend SIX whole seconds just to reload the low clip on this stupid gun! Count to six and that's how much time you're waiting inbetween fire. In six seconds, you could lose all your armor and health and straight die while waiting for this thing to reload. And yes, being you only have two guns and some grenades throughout this whole game, I tried the Call of Duty style "switch to your other gun as you run out of ammo instead of reloading" tactic, only for that to not work as the stupid generic character you're using automatically reloads the gun when you run low or run out, so in order for the Call of Duty trick to work, I'd have to watch and make sure I don't go below ten bullets left and THEN, switch to the other gun in order for it to work, as the character's auto-reloading is completely and totally un-interruptable. SO annoying! WHY should a player have to endure crap like this? Throughout the whole game, I either used the Harrington despite it's insanely slow reload and some kind of rocket or grenade launcher, as anything else would be ineffective, have too small of a clip, hold too little of maximum ammo, or simply be just too weak. Sounds fun, doesn't it?The "characters" in this game aren't even characters. There's you, the generic, namelss "agent." (Maybe "Agent" is your actual name. I don't know.) There's the disembodied commander narrator/boss guy, who'll remark such sayings as, "Go like the wind, agent!" and "Simply pathetic." when you die. Having the game insult you every time you die, and dying because of some stupid glitch or flaw, is enough to make you want to break the game disc into tiny, little pieces. The "bad guys" are perhaps the most generic looking criminal bosses ever. It's like they looked in an LA phone book to get names for the Spanish lieutenants. There are three "gangs" that rule the city, but they're more like criminal empires because street gangs don't have that many soldiers and they don't actually run entire sectors of a city and it's inhabitants. They are  "Los Muertos" or "The Dead" (pretty clever, eh?), The Volk, and Shai Gen. Or... "Generic Spanish gang," "Generic Russian gang," and "Generic Chinese Corporation gang."The key members of the gang, like I said, are about as generic-looking as generic can get and when you actually find out where they're located and kill the hundreds of bad guys guarding them before you realize that they keep randomally spawning and that you should ignore them and just run towards the main gang lieutenant and kill them, you'll be rewarded with nothing, in the guise of a slightly higher ratio for success. You see, the game developers thought that it'd be clever to make fighting the main gang leader virtually impossible and that you would have more "fun" by taking out key lieutenants, who each enhance the criminal empire, be it by firearms, number of soldiers available, vehicles, etc., so that it becomes slightly easier to take out the main gang leader. But even WHEN you kill everyone else and save him for last, it's STILL virtually impossible, between the miles long approach to their headquarters, the endless spawning soldiers, and the enemy's eight life bars. Like most strongholds in the game, you're best to just run past everyone, trying to survive, and just go all out on the major gang leader before all the minions kill you. Screw "weaking their health" or "minimizing their recruits" with killing the lieutenants, because they won't do much help for you, regardless. But then, I guess, the game would be too short. In this case though, that'd be a good thing.I should also bring up that the map is even messed up. Yes, that's right! Even the MAP is a pain in the donkey. Not only is the map horribly out-of-scale with everything else, and not only does the map not provide you with any GPS or waypoint marking, but you CAN'T EVEN ZOOM IT IN! The map on the menu screen is just a tiny little map on the menu screen. You can't zoom it in to see closer, or anything. And the arrow representing you on the map takes up an entire city block in reality, meaning things that you may think are close by may be two blocks away from you! How often is it that you can say that the map in a video game is one of it's many, many flaws? Okay, so you can't zoom in, use a GPS, or even accurately know where you're at. Surely, the HUD "radar" map must be better, right? Nope. The biggest problem is, unlike ANY other game that uses an on-screen map, there's no "N" for "North." Just four arrows, any one of them could possibly be north. There's a reason why they don't put the "S"outh, "E"ast, and "W"est on these, and this is why. YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING! I can't tell you how many times I had to pause the game just to figure out which way was North. I often had to look one direction, pause to see the full map to see where I'm facing on it, and then, turn again until I got to facing North or where ever it is I had to go. How could they not have even gotten this right? It also would've been helpful if, being you spend most the game on the roof, to know which enemies were eye-to-eye level with me, above me, or below me. Usually, they make all things above you an arrow facing up on these game maps, and all things below facing down. But, oh no, not in this game! I died so many times because I couldn't tell if any enemy gang were shooting from above, from below, or from so far away, they wouldn't even show up in the compass map screen. Every single enemy is just a dot. Even if they're above me or below me. It's things like this that make you appreciate the little things in any given Grand Theft Auto title, where you don't have to try to figure out where North is, and that the arrows or triangles let you know right away which altitude an enemy is at. But not in this game! In fact, I've seen an effective map system in about EVERY Xbox 360 game that uses one, EXCEPT this game! Oh, and you can't even zoom the map in. Ins't that just something else?When you die, you have to restart from a "supply station," most of which are few are isolated between locations, and all of them have to be found and unlocked. Oh, and they're ALL on roofs, meaning you have to spend ten minutes climbing up top to them, and you could die just trying to get down from them! An elevator that you can use once you get up to the top the first time would've been nice. I mean, they actually HAVE them in the game and all, so it's not like they would've had to make one from scratch or anything. Any good gun you collect from an enemy HAS to be taken to this supply center/save point in order for you to keep it, or else, you'll lose everything you collected once you die. Sometimes, because of the random enemy pop ups, you'll, ironically, die trying to get back to your save point in order to save the guns you just got in case you die. You could be at any given rooftop, look one way, then look back and have a hoarde of random enemies pop up at you. Sometimes, you can even see them materialize in front of you. Sometimes, you'll restart at a save point and by chance, there'll be a ton of enemies right in front of your face as you just come back from the dead. I don't know. Maybe killing so many enemies as if they were an ant colony and jumping from rooftops sounds fun, but it's really not. Neither is dying a thousand times due to a broken aiming system or enemy grenade. You can still die by gravity, by the way, so with each roof, you still have to be very careful.The only good thing I can say about the game is that there's no glitches. Oh, wait. There are! Like, constantly getting stuck in a wall, or a rampway, or even the ground! Stuck as in, "this solid object isn't all that solid" stuck. And the random enemies. That counts, too. It's bad enough that once you kill every enemy in the near area, the game will have a "hit squad" of about ten cars come up and bring MORE enemies to you, but to have the ones you JUST KILLED re-materialize right in front of you is just insulting. Like, why even bother to kill them if it just makes more come to kill you, and the dead ones simply return back like it's nothing? Your character is a genetic clone and "The Agency" can make an endless supply of you in case you die. What's their excuse, though?Overall, this kind of pointless 3D "shoot and jump" kind of simplistic game wouldn't have been so bad on the N64, the original Playstation, or even as an early Gamecube title. I mean, the comic-book like art style isn't anything impressive or new or advanced. 1999 to 2002, this game might've been acceptable. An "average" game, at best. But this kind of simple, pointless, storyline-less, linear "shoot and kill just for the sake of it" game is far below what today's standards are in gaming. To imagine that this is an Xbox 360 title makes me think that this game probably spent so many years in development, that it's heavily outdated by today's standards. When you can't even tell which way is North on your compass map, you can't even zoom in your menu-guide map, and every single character is as generic as a white and black-text can of government corn, it really isn't a game ready to be released. At least not in any year past 2003, on any system greater than maybe Gamecube. This game is bad for simply being simple and outdated and just, really frustrating and lame and incomplete. I can't give this game a One because other than the "getting stuck" and "targeting," there really aren't any glitches or bugs in it. The game is somewhat playable.However, when a game makes you want to break something in it's incompleteness, or lose your mind and curse after getting killed by some stupid game flaw for the 219th time, something ain't right. I can't imagine anyone over twelve enjoying this game, not to insult anyone under thirteen, but only a simple minded person could enjoy a game this simple and generic. By the cover and art style, the game looks kind of cool. You sort of think "Gears Of War" combined with "Saint's Row." You get to use some high tech equipment to take down three ethnic gangs crippling the city. Sounds fun. And I'm sure, most people who bought this game bought it for the Halo 3 beta, but also because it looked or sounded like fun, right? However, I haven't played a game THIS bad since "Sonic Heroes." (and I would include every other Sonic game since then, had I actually played those also-poorly-rated titles) This is a game you simply want to break with your bare hands, or sell to any gaming store, even if you can only get $2.95 for it. Shoot, ANY amount of money the guy offers you at a game store, you'll take just to not have this horrible curse of a game in your life anymore. I can't say it's a Legend in the "Worst Games Of All Time" ranking, but it's definitely one of those games you'll get rid of, by any means possible, just to not have in your collection. It's like the DVD of "Gigli" or "I Know Who Killed Me" in your DVD collection that makes everything else you own, as well as yourself, look bad just by it's mere prescence, so you get rid of it, possibly erase all save files of it from your memory card or hard drive too, and pretend like it never happened. Yes, this game is a "pretend like it never happened" kind of game.AVOID this disaster at all costs! It's not fun, it's frustrating, and it's not even in-depth.
TL;DR:  Amazing singleplayer, OK multiplayer, which is a disgrace for a Halo game.It's been four years since the last events of Halo 3, when the Master Chief destroyed Delta Halo and was stranded on the other half of Forward Unto Dawn, drifting towards an unknown planet.  Halo 4 picks up right after Halo 3's Legendary Ending.To start, the game looks amazing.  It is clearly the best-looking console game to have ever been released.  Cortana has never looked better in a Halo game, and the facial structures and emotions from the humans in the game are simply a work of art.  Sometimes, I couldn't even tell if it's just a game of if they used real actors during the cutscenes.  The story of the campaign is easy (enough) to follow, but I wish they would've gone over what happened between Halo 3 and Halo 4.  More on that later in the spoiler section.The controls take a bit to get used to, since they tried to copy Call of Duty but with a slight Halo twist.  Banshee tricks are no longer mapped to the A button; you use LB to pull them off (WHY?!!!!), but other than that, if you didn't get so used to Halo: Reach's control scheme, you should be fine here.  Personally, I wish they would stop changing the controls so much and stick to what worked in Halo 2.  The gameplay itself, when it comes to the campaign, is your typical Halo experience we have all loved since 2001 when the original Halo launched with the original Xbox 360.  You're running through levels, shooting old and new enemies, uncovering the story, and reaching the end of a short campaign.  It took me five hours to be the campaign on Normal, but double that on Legendary.  I personally think the writing and the voice acting was well-done for everyone except Master Chief.  Some of his lines are unbelievable, and the painfully wrong tone is used sometimes.  However, it's still the campaign we expected from a Halo game.  But is the multiplayer the same we've loved since Halo 2?  No.  Unfortunately, no where near it.To start off, Halo 4's multiplayer has gone through a bit of a change since it first came out.  They greatly reduced the auto-aim that was present when the game first came out (nothing wrong with that), and have added a few new modes.  They also recently added in SWAT and FFA Throwback.  FFA Throwback is basically what the original FFA mode in the game should've been, ripped straight from Halo 2.  FFA KoTH and Oddball are FINALLY available to play.  For some odd reason, though, they removed Team Snipers. But if you bought Halo 4 hoping to have as much fun online as you did in Halo 3 or Halo 2, you will be more disappointed than I am.  I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I am with the multiplayer.For one, they introduced a CoD-style loadout menu.  Now you can pick your primary, secondary, grenade, armor ability, and two perks from the Infinity menu.  First of all, when was the last time Halo had perks?  I didn't play Reach so I can't speak for that game, but as far as I'm concerned, NO Halo game has ever used perks, period.  Why are they in Halo 4?  If I wanted to play Call of Duty, I would've waited for Black Ops 2 instead of picking this up a day after release.  I don't mind being able to choose what weapon I want to use, I'm actually glad they FINALLY let me use the DMR over the Assault Rifle instead of having to hunt for it on the map, but perks?  On top of that, gone is the hectic fast-paced action from Halo 2 and 3.  For example, I like to use the armor ability Promethean Vision because it lets me see enemies through walls.  And I have yet to play a game where someone wasn't crouched behind a corner waiting for someone to pass them, or behind a box, or underneath the enemy base waiting for someone to walk down.  Camping has always been in Halo; those that loved the sniper know what I'm talking about.  But to see it in literally EVERY single Halo 4 game I play online is horrific.  Gone are the arena-style FPS days of Halo when you got destroyed because people had a better shot and reaction time than you.  Now, all you need to do is pick Cloak, find a corner, and sit and wait for someone to walk by so you can either shotgun them from behind or assassinate them.  Unfortunately, Team Slayer Pro, a game mode that eliminates the motion sensor, armor abilities, and perks, does nothing to fix this issue.  If anything, it's worse, because people are now more likely to hide in a corner knowing that no one but their teammates will know they're there.  Oh, remember seeing an X where your teammate died in Halo 2?  Those are gone in Halo 4.  So now you have no idea where your teammate died.  His clan tag just disappears and comes back when he respawns.Another thing wrong with the multiplayer is the matchmaking.....I'm sorry, I meant the lack of matchmaking.  There is nothing that determines the players you're matched with.  For example, Halo 3 allowed you to choose between the quickest process or to only search for games with a good connection.  Those are completely gone from Halo 4.  I once played a game with a person from Guam.  Guam, for those that don't know, is a little island controlled by the United States that is located above Indonesia.  Can anyone explain to me how in the world someone that's thousands of miles away from the closest coastline of the United States managed to connect to someone living in the Midwest?  I stopped playing Uncharted online for the very same issue.  Too many times did I get paired with people that weren't even within my borders (Egypt, Portugal, Spain, UK, Brazil, etc).  There's nothing wrong with playing with foreigners themselves, it's just that the server I have to connect to in order to play with a foreigner is so far away, my ping is going to be ridiculously high, which means I'll experience a high amount of lag.  The only game I can think of that gave me little-to-no lag while playing with Europeans is Battlefield 3, which has dedicated servers.  Halo 4 does NOT have dedicated servers.  Another problem that comes with the lack of proper matchmaking is the mismatch of player levels.  It's never a good idea to pit a level 56, 65, 47, and 70 against a group filled with those still in the 10's and 20's, and I shouldn't have to tell you why.  Because of the absence of dedicated servers, there are times where the game will change hosts.  This is nothing new in a Halo game....except for the fact that someone may have killed you by the time your screen turns normal.  I've had that happen to me twice.My biggest complaint with the multiplayer, besides it being too much like Call of Duty and not enough like Halo, is Spartan Ops.  Spartan Ops is the biggest P.O.S. I have ever played since Uncharted 3's multiplayer.  NOTHING is good about Spartan Ops.  The entire thing feels rushed.  The cutscenes are short and make me miss dramatic pauses I originally thought were over-done in a lot of games and movies.  The lack of dramatic pauses makes me feel like "OK, what's going on h....oh...on to a new scene.  OK what's going o.......onto ANOTHER new scene".  I don't have time to take in and digest what I just saw/heard two seconds ago.  On top of that, the cutscenes are literally crap.  This person talks, this person responds, this person goes somewhere else, says "this is wrong" (Really, Sherlock?!), some random end scene, end cutscene.  I can go to YouTube if I wanted to laugh at short videos all day.  To make matters worse, the actual gameplay is more boring and repetitive than Firefight from the previous Halo.  At least Firefight was challenging and time consuming (even though those types of modes I have never liked).  Spartan Ops is literally, "kill these enemies, then kill some more, now move here, kill some more, hit some random switch, VEHICLES! :D, kill the last few enemies before the dropship arrives, end of episode".  An entire episode of Spartan Ops (five per chapter) takes ten minutes at the most, and that's on Heroic while playing with a group of randoms.  You just sit there, kill kill kill, boring dialogue, vehicles, end game, and you're then sitting there wondering "Why in God's name did I just waste 10 minutes of my life?"  The fact that these keep coming out every week only hurts Spartan Ops; that only adds to the repetitive feel of the mode.  The part that had me crying from laughing so hard is there are rumors (as of me writing this review and to my knowledge) that 343 Industries plan on charging for the second season of Spartan Ops.  YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!!  That's a bigger rip-off than paying for cheat-codes, like Capcom has tried to do many times before.  Personally, Halo 4 would've been a better game if they stopped wasting resources on the abomination that is Spartan Ops and actually spent them improving the multiplayer.**WARNING!!!  WARNING!!!  SPOILERS BELOW THIS POINT!!**As much as I liked Halo 4's campaign, like I said before, I wished they had explained more in the game.  For one, I had no bleeping clue who the Didact was until halfway through the game when the Librarian (again, don't know who she was, either, or why she was important) explained a bit of the history pre-Halo 1.  It would've been wonderful if the game was more friendly to newcomers/people who haven't been following the story/people who didn't read every book and watched every video made about the story.  I don't like having to search through hundreds of material to find out information on some of the events going on in Halo 4.  Granted the Librarian did do a fairly-good job catching me up, I STILL want to know, what happened to the Brutes?  They're just gone.  What happened to the truce between the Elites and UNSC?  Even Master Chief says this at the beginning of the game, "I thought we had a truce with the Covenant".  Now they're back at their old tactics, looking for random artifacts on some random planet for religious reasons, and making sure those filthy humans don't taint holy land.  Another thing I wish was more explained was what happened to the Arbiter after Halo 3.  A side-story on Halo: Waypoint explains he took the remaining Elites from the rebellion back to their home world.  OK, so why are they fighting alongside the rest of the Covenant?  They also barely talk about the Flood in Halo 4, and our favorite parasite is also absent from the game.  You blow up Delta Halo in Halo 3 and all of a sudden, no more Flood?  Maybe an explanation for some of my questions were explained in side-material, but again, I would've appreciated it if Halo 4 explained some loose ends, even briefly.Another problem I had with the campaign, besides it being short and a bit ridiculous on Legendary (headshots should kill shieldless enemies, period), why does Master Chief have such bad voice acting?  When Cortana informs him that she's not going back to Infinity with him, he stumbles with his words, then changes his tone completely when he says "We go together".  He went from complete disbelief to sounding like he was barking an order to a Marine.  It's so painfully obvious that it doesn't match, that ONE bit of the campaign is something I'll remember for a while.  I'm actually a bit neutral towards them showing his face for the Legendary ending.  His eyes were blacked out, but you got a pretty good idea of his facial features.  Nothing too major, of course.** END OF SPOILERS!!!**Overall, I miss Bungie.  I do like the campaign 343 created, and the graphics are amazing, but considering the multiplayer is only OK at best, it's a huge disgrace to the Halo franchise.  Halo's multiplayer has never been "OK".  Let's not forget it was the console king until Call of Duty 4 was released.  Unfortunately, 343's methods of handling the issues is quite poor, and makes me miss the way Bungie interacted with its fans.
I really went back and forth on this game, and had a lot of trouble deciding whether this game deserved three or four stars. As I thought about it more, I felt that even though I had a lot of fun playing it, this is just not a four star game. Allow me to elaborate...A common joke is that the first game in this series would have completely tanked if the Halo 3 beta code had not been shipped out in this game (and maybe they are right). I just thought the game looked like a lot of fun, so I bought it, Halo 3 aside. The original was not heavy on plot, and, like this second game, a lot of the "missions" feel grinding and repetitive. However, the first game made that grind a lot easier to bear in a number of small ways, all of which have been completely left out of this incarnation. I'm getting a little tired of developers 'fixing' sequels until they're broken.>>Plot:&lt;&lt;So let's talk about the plot, although this will be a short topic. Crackdown 2 has even less plot than the first one, which is hard to do. Now, my entire review won't just be a comparison of the second to the first, but I think for people who didn't play the first game, it is necessary to make a comparison to the first games' plot. So...in the first Crackdown, your goal is to fully eliminate three gangs that have taken over Pacific City. Reclaim it, area by area, one step at a time. You start with rank and file gangsters, and work your way up the gang hierarchy until you finally are able to go after the gang leader in their stronghold. There were personal dossiers on all the important players within that gang, how this effected that, how it would improve your chances of success if you took out every single one of the under-bosses before going after the heavy hitters.Incidentally, this tiny feature was something I REALLY liked in the original. For those who didn't play it, every time you went after an important gang member, your "Chances of Success" would be displayed. So if you were going after an under-boss and you had already taken out the four lieutenants working under him, your odds of success would be displayed accordingly, a much higher percentage than if you had only taken out one -- or none! So occasionally if you accidentally stumbled into the stronghold of a more senior leader and you saw "Chance of Success: 12.2%," I can't speak for anyone else, but I personally thought 'Sweet, this should be a real challenge then!' Of course if I kept dying, I would just give it up for a while. It was a tiny thing, but it added a bit of tension that is needed when you're playing a character with superhuman abilities.Now as I stated before, this second game has even less plot than the barely plot of the first one. But let's face it, Crackdown is not really meant to be a story-based game. The fun comes from being able to leap fifty feet from one rooftop to the next, pick up a streetlight pole and bash your enemies, chain together explosions to cause some massive destruction, kick enemies off of rooftops, shoot out a tire on a fast moving car and watch as it slides -- and then flips over...it's an action game, completely. And like a good action movie, there doesn't have to be a whole lot of plot or character development to have fun. And so it is the case of this game. So why do I give a non-story-based game three stars if I am not taking the story into account? Let me explain...The story is that ten years have passed since the events of the first game, the original agency tower was bombed, a virus leaked out of one of the three gangs' labs, and infected parts of the population (cue 'Freaks'). To go along with this, a new gang has essentially taken over the city. Your objective, your one objective (seriously, in the game there is only one objective [with numerous sub-objectives leading up to it]) is to rid the city of the Freak infestation. You do this by powering up energy sources in groups of three that shoot some sort of magical beams of blue light, and where the three points meet, then underneath that is a Freak lair, where you have to go and defend a beacon that is dropped via helicopter until it powers up, at which point it eliminates all the Freaks in the area. You defend the area by murdering every Freak that attacks the beacon as it is charging. Couldn't the helicopter just let the beacon power up first, and THEN drop it down into the lair? I mean then there would be no need to show a beam of light shooting up out of the beacon to meet the points of light above it...Apparently the beams of light know to shoot straight down to power the beacon remotely...or something. I don't understand...but I don't think the writers and developers really did either. So whatever just go with it. Yeah just don't ask them any specific questions though, ok.There are no plot twists, no secrets are revealed, you just do this. You activate 27 energy things, and detonate 9 beacons across the entire city. Along with that, you can also reclaim 25 (?) tactical locations from the gang inhabiting the city (basically they become strongholds or safe havens after you reclaim them where you can switch your weapon, grenade, and vehicle load-out). Talk about a drag. The same thing 25 times. As soon as you start the battles, about thirty enemies immediately spawn all around you, some of which have grenade or homing rocket launchers. You better run or jump out of there and take cover fast, because otherwise you're going to get pounded and will not be able to return fire. It's a bit of overkill, but I suppose they couldn't make it too easy or it would just be boring. Either way it does end up getting boring. But I guess it could have been worse, there could have been like a hundred of these tactical locations though. ALTHOUGH, then there are Freak Breaches, places where your beacons have damaged the ground and Freaks are pouring out. Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't the beacons sole purpose to eradicate the Freak presence in that area? So please tell me how Freaks are going to pouring out of the ground at or very near a beacon epicenter. Honestly, do they think we're stupid? Basically it is the exact same thing as taking back the tactical locations. Kill a lot of them until no more come out. Boooooooooring. And that is the whole game. I don't say that's basically the whole game, it is the entire game, plot-wise. Obviously there are still things like rooftop races and road races, and agility orbs to collect. But that is the extent of the plot. Also, the beacon detonations are the only thing driving the plot. The Tactical locations and the Breaches are secondary objectives, and are not necessary at all to complete the story, which is extremely short. What lengthens the game is the desire to upgrade your character's abilities, and this, like the first game, is the real fun.The ending of the game is another gripe. So...the game ends, I won't spoil anything. And it leaves it open for...downloadable content? Or a third installment ($$$). But the way they did it is dumb. Basically they end the game where you cannot continue playing after you complete the game. You can just go back and reload your last save game after you beat it. But far from making me look forward to a Crackdown 3, I really feel like it's just a cop-out. Plot is a rare commodity in these games, so why not continue the story? God knows it could have use a change of direction...but whatever, we'll see where the downloadable content takes us, if anywhere.>>Graphics:&lt;&lt;I have read a number of reviews already about Crackdown 2 having lame graphics...but I don't really understand this. The graphics look nearly identical to the original, which is intentional. I would have been upset if the game started to try to take itself seriously and NOT have used cell shading. The game has its own style, and it's one of the reasons I like this franchise overall, because it is original in that way. I know I might be in the minority here, but honestly, can't people stop whining about graphics? Those games you loved to play ten years ago? Horrible graphics, compared to where they are today. Honestly people need to get over having things look nice. Avatar looks amazing too, but I hated it because everything in it was so one-dimensional. So basically what I'm saying is that a game should be judged by what is under the hood, with one caveat: Obviously there are games that boast amazing visuals, or where it would actually be expected of the game, and where this is the case, it can be judged likewise. But Crackdown 2? If what you're looking for is epic visuals or gritty textures, then I'm afraid you have missed the point entirely about what Crackdown 2 is aiming for.>>Gameplay:&lt;&lt;I had a very love/hate relationship with the gameplay in Crackdown 2. It seems like they made it more complex and accomplished even less than the original. I have read numerous other reviews detailing how awful the targeting system is in this game...but for the most part, it's a relatively small annoyance (But don't get me wrong, there are parts when it will really frustrate you. When I went to lock on to one of the ten enemies all firing around me, why did I lock on to an agency (Those are your allies) cruiser way off in the distance? To add on to that, when you are battling a horde of 'Freaks,' (Zombie-like enemies that try to overwhelm you with sheer numbers), I think it would have been better, when you go to lock on to one of them specifically when there are fifty all rushing you, to have it lock on to the one that is the most dangerous to you. I don't know, it makes sense to me. Kinda pointless otherwise.I had a few issues with clipping and with seeing some npc's start to descend a flight of stairs and then fall straight through them (though I had no problems with that myself, so I don't really hold that against the game, it's just worth mentioning). I did, however, have some problems with on-again off-again grappling when I would try to jump to a ledge. In certain locations (few, but still irritating), I would jump to a ledge, hang there, then try jumping to another ledge, and if I missed, I would try to catch the ledge I had jumped from, but my character would not grab it. Then when I would try to jump to it again, he wouldn't grab it. When I came back at other times though, it was fine...so...I don't know, doesn't make sense to me.>>The Silver Lining:&lt;&lt;I should talk now about what the game does right, or, to rephrase, what the developers didn't change from the original. The agility orbs. There are 500 once again, and once again, they are fun to track down. Crackdown 2 also has implemented a twist on this, called Renegade Orbs. There orbs will streak away from you, dive, rise, turn sharply -- as you try to catch them. At first I thought it was irritating, but there is a sense of accomplishment when you do mange to catch one as it slows down to change direction. It just requires some patience and a little luck. They do the same thing with the driving skill. There are Renegade driving orbs as well. 30 of each kind.The weapons are pretty cool, though one frustration they didn't eliminate (go figure) from the first game is that you will have to equip and carry any new found weapons back to a tactical location so that you can use it in the future. It would be nice if you just unlocked them as you leveled up the weapons skill. But whatever, minor gripe. And it just occurred to me that they also did away with pistols in the game altogether, though obviously since I am just now noticing this (after playing through the entire game without noticing it), it isn't anything you will really miss. The weapons are essentially the same as the first game, but with different names. I would have liked to see an introduction of melee weapons though. Since you can pick up environment objects and swing them, it would have been cool to be offered a sword or a baseball bat or something actually designed to be used as a melee weapon (as opposed to picking up a car and smashing it repeatedly into enemies' faces!). Some vehicles also have weapons on them now. The Agency Buggy has a gatling gun, as do some Cell (gang) cars, as well as a rocket launcher variety. The Agency supercar also still has the 'Scoop' ability (You can drive under other vehicles and it scoops them out of your way without interrupting your driving).>>Conclusion:&lt;&lt;My final advice is not to expect too much. I think a number of people did, and then were let down. This game should be played for fun. The over-the-top-everything in this game has to be the ends in itself, and not the means to the end of the story, because there isn't much of one. I still think that this game is extremely fun and addicting, even taken with all of the flaws it has. This game can provide you with hours of fun if you don't try to force it to be any more than it is.
I was one of the many that pre-ordered halo 2 because I enjoyed the first one so much. About me and seven of my friends bought it at the midnight release and went to my buddies house where we played it all night and my friend and I beat the co-op storyline around 8 or 9 the next morning. There were some things I liked and hated about the game.Storyline: If you played the first one the storyline is lacking and really straightforward. You play the "hero", fight against aliens and save humanity/earth whatever. For the second one when they released video clips it made it sound as if the aliens found earth and are attacking it and you (master chief) were turning earth into a crazy urban war between humans and aliens. Its been a long time since I played the storyline, actually the night of its release was the last time, but you only end up fighting on earth for the first one or two levels (I use the term lightly as halo has no "real" levels). Then you end up going into one of the alien ships or something like that. You also get to play as one of the aliens, which I found to be rather fun but also a "played" story gimmick as this has happened in other games as well. The ending was very dissapointing as it just left you hanging and wanting more and hoping there was actually more to the story left. Bungie could have done a better job and made the story more developed and the game a bit longer.Graphics: I've read a lot of reviews saying that the graphics are awesome but I didn't see a great deal of difference between halo and halo 2. However, I also didn't play either game with HD cables on an HDTV. They used the same engine and just added what seemed to me a polishing effect to the "levels" and characters.Sound: I love the music to halo and I was happy to hear the music back in Halo 2. Also the human and alien voices are fun to hear. The multiplayer firefights and single player firefights are wonderfully done as it helps to make you feel like you're actually there in the game.Weapons: I was dissapointed in the weapon selection as there seemed to be no imagination to what they did with them. Humans have a sniper rifle so lets give aliens a sniper rifle. Humans have rocket launchers (the rocket launcher now targets and follows enemy vehicles-nice!) so aliens need a rocket launcher. The plasma rifle was given an unneeded change as it no longer froze your enemies in place to circle around them and hit them in the back, which made the rifle now another useless weapon in your arsenal. I enjoyed the sword in single player but in multiplayer was a very frustrating weapon to fight against. In single player the sword ran out of charge after so many hits but in multiplayer it lasted the whole game which was a very annoying thing. If you've ever played halo 2 multiplayer you know what I'm talking about. The pistol was toned way down but with few updates they gave it some power back but was nowhere near the "horror" like the first. Grenades were the most and saddest thing they changed in the game. I loved grenades in the first one and ended up using them more than anything in the game. So when I played halo 2 the first time I couldn't wait to throw my first grenade and when I did I literally freaked out. Master Chief "dropped" the grenade right in front of me and when the explosion happened I was still alive??? They turned Master Chief's powerful throwing into a "toss" or "drop" and the explosion of the grenade......well lets just say I might as well have been throwing waterballoons at the aliens with the damage that one of those did. The last thing they did was duel-wield which was a nice feature but the balance of duel-wield and other weapons was crap. The duel thing could've been left out and was a much over-hyped feature.Vehicles: Like I said with imagination- Bungie seemed to be lacking in that department. Humans have a tank and a warthog so lets give the covenant a tank and warthog. I know, I know the covenant tank was in the first one but could you drive it?? Nope. I liked the fact that vehicles now could be blown up and that you could kick people out of the vehicle and take it or if you were crazy like me you could jump in a warthog with an opposing team driving it, thats always fun. I do wish they would have given you the option to turn vehicle damage on or off. In multiplayer you would destroy the warthog and a few minutes later they would have a brand new one waiting for them, so that was annoying too. The last thing they changed that I didn't like was I couldn't run over people anymore, well you can but its a 1 in 6 shot that you'll actually do it.Physics Engine: I hate the physics in halo 2, one thing that made the original halo so fun was playing "warthog basketball" in blood gulch or blowing up a ghost over the middle of sidewinder and watching it fly.Multiplayer: Multiplayer is chaotic and can be fun but 70% of the time if you're not playing with a friend it is frustrating to hear people cussing you out, making really annoying background sounds etc. The addition of "team chat" only would've been really nice. Most of the upgrades they did to the multiplayer levels were nice and done really well, the name changes weren't really necessary though. I liked the setup for the xbl matching, I just wish that the players had more control over what levels, weapons, radar and such would go on during the game instead of the pre-made matches (that counted to your ranking) that you ended up playing over and over and over and over again. Also the hacking and modded xbox's that you would play sucked too, that was neither bungie's nor microsoft's fault, but did hinder the fun of the multiplayer experience.Vision change: For the longes time I couldn't figure out why halo 2 seemed visually different than halo 1. One day, it hit me, I was playing multiplayer and was running around getting p'wned as I usually did in halo 2 and I realized the levels were closer to me than in the first one. I realized the developers went for a tunnel vision view instead of the periphial expanded look as in the previous one. In halo when I walked around, I had a periphial view and the levels looked so much larger and massive. In halo 2, however, they give you a more narrow view and make everything seem closer for a more "unreal" look, by unreal I mean like the unreal series.Single player exploration: This is one of the things that made the original halo so awesome. My friends and I would spend countless hours in the single player mode going to areas we really weren't supposed to go and do things that were absolutely fun and crazy. You could actually get online and see things people would do and it made it all the more entertaining. In halo 2 they "controlled" the areas that you were not supposed to get to by putting skulls or I think in one level there was a huge ball or something. That made me lose the appeal to actually go and explore the level like I did in the first one. Now the developers want me to go find these "hidden" places that I wasn't supposed to......puh-lease!!So to sum it all up, the cons seemed to outweigh the pros for me as an avid Halo 1 fan. The lack of vehicle and weapon imagination, physics engine change, tunnel vision with the short and dissapointing ending storyline made the rush of halo 2's release makes Halo 2 an average to below average first person shooter experience. Halo 2's multiplayer is fun with friends and the added detail in the levels makes it more tactical and visual treat. If you're looking for a game that has a good story and imagination this is NOT the game for you but if you just wanna play a fun shooter with some friends its not to bad of a game.It only gets 2 stars from this dissapointed halo fan.....
