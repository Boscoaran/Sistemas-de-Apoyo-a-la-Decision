MechCommander 2 is a lot like its predecessor, drawing on the rich BattleTech universe to make an RTS that brings the feel of the board game to the PC. Those of you who haven't played the first installment yet should go out and buy the original (I recommend MC Gold, which added some missions and fixed some bugs), not because it's necessary but it's better. For the rest of you, I'll put this review in terms of differences from MC Gold.First off, the graphics are much better and are true 3D, not isometric. Whether you like this or not is simply your aesthetic taste, because it's never really necessary to rotate the camera. 'Mech customization is more realistic and costs money, which adds another layer of force management (but simple shoot-and-smash players will find annoying).Speaking of shoot-and-smash, one of the great things about the original was that there was no "golden path": even though your mission log was linear, you could beat any given mission in a number of ways, leading to some decent replay value. MC2's missions seem to lose this, which is a huge loss because every now and then I still crack out MechCommander 1 almost a decade later.MC2 does make three big improvements over the original. Salvage is now much more realistic. In MC1, you'd be lucky to get one in every 10 you shot. Now, you get about 8 or 9 out of every ten, but you have to pay to salvage them (don't worry, it's not mandatory to salvage everything). Rather than the fog-of-war-blackness in MC1's maps (which made no sense because you could see them in the mission briefing but not the mission itself), MC2 lets you see the entire map but utilizes line-of-sight to spot the enemy. Finally, rather than giving players a fixed number of fire support and counting support vehicles against the player's drop weight, all these are grouped under a new support tab. Since the new salvage system made the resource warehouses and container stacks of MC1 obsolete, the new incarnations of the above give players resource points, which they can use to call in several forms of air support. Mostly these correspond to what we saw in the original, with the minesweeper being replaced by the Karnov Salvage Craft, which allows in-mission salvage of 'Mechs. I found losing the minesweeper a curious choice because, unlike the MC1, there are missions where it would actually be useful here.In summary, MC2 brought in a lot of cool new features (not all of which I listed here), but did so at the expense of mission depth. So, unfortunately, MC2 is not as good as MC1.

After swearing that I'd stick with "Flight Simulator 2002" and forego upgrading it with FS2004, I had a second opportunity to fly this ship.  While it's still not quite the wonder sim I thought it would be, FS2004 is a dependable performer.  While I was quite happy with 2002, 2004 adds more integrated Air Traffic Control, more realistic looking GPS and pre-flight navigation.  In two ways, the new game outshines the ancestors: first is its weather generator - with the most believable clouds of the series - atmospheric effects are much more fluid than on previous incarnations; secondly, the game's engine more appropriately models both the physical and aerodynamic aspects of each plane - rather than just flight performance, we have a better feel for each plane's dimensions, weight and mechanisms, with obvious improvements in the modeling of control surfaces, retracting landing gear, doors and vapor trails.  (A great example is the Piper Cub, in which the control cables are a visible part of the flight panel and respond to aileron inputs, but I digress...).  Scenery is improved over 2002 - living in the NYC area, I had fun sim-flying along Long Island's south shore.THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS FREE IN-FLIGHT LUNCH: All that performance comes at a price, and despite a systems requirement for a CPU in the conservative 450mhz range, I experienced only better than marginal performance on a PC with 6 times that horsepower.  The likely critical factor is a video card - my Dell system lacks an AGP or PCI-e bus, so I've been slow to get past Intel's ridiculously underpowered and misnamed Extreme graphics chipset.  Frame-rate is smooth, but that's with the options turned down.  I still get great looking weather, but AI traffic is painfully sparse.  Water effects seemed better in FS2002, with dynamic waves and such of that game missing here.  Performance on comparable notebook computers will likely suffer even more.  You get more aircraft with this game than older versions - but then again, older versions were always able to accept 3rd party aircraft.  The physics of hovering aircraft like Harriers or helicopters seems little changed from the days when people were able to add those planes in FS4 (late 80's early 1990's).  Being no stranger to Flight Simulator, I found it was slightly trickier to install add-on aircraft to FS2004 than on the older incarnations of the game - installing some aircraft had the result of missing working gauges; some planes wouldn't install at all.NOTAM: If you've got a better than decent graphics card (a Radeon 9XXX or GeForce FX) and missed the last few editions of MSFS, then FS2004 is great fodder for your inner armchair aviator; If you've spent less on your system's graphics card than on getting every copy of MSFS made since the days of "Flight Simulator for Windows `95", then maybe you should stick with FS2002.NO WILDLIFE WAS ABUSED IN THE REVIEW OF THIS PRODUCT EXCEPT: My PC, a Dell Pentium 4 (3.2 Ghz) with 512mb RAM, and no graphics acceleration (yet).

I've got Combat Flight Simulator-1 (CFS1 - Europe) but bought this one too for the naval aviation aspect, and thought it cheaper to buy CFS2 than the pacific expansion disks released for the older game.  (Virtually all WWII sims of the past decade were set in Europe.  Despite a large number of titles, there hasn't been any PTO sims of note since "1942: Pacific Air War" and "Pacific Strike" of the mid 1990's.  Microprose followed PAW up with European Air War and the similarly set "B-17"; EA/Janes followed "World War 2 Fighters" with "Attack Squadron" - both set over Europe; MS returned to Europe with CFS3, bypassing Korea which richly deserved attention)  In CFS2, you fly missions from Japanese or American island bases or carriers.In many ways, CFS2 excels as an improvement over the older CFS1 (naval aviation aside), but is also a major disappointment for the exact same reason:  if you own the older game as I do, you'll probably spend more time trying to spot the improvements than just enjoying it.  Though the premise is different and sports a newer look between the missions (where the bleak look of CFS1 seems to have been inspired by episodes of "World at War", colorful comic-strip panels that seem inspired by nose-art ala Roy Lichtenstein dominates CFS2; if you saw the old Marvel Superheroes adventures of the 1960?s, you know what I mean), the game never capitalizes enough on its newer concept to break away from CFS1.  You're still in a pure fighter sim, using the same tactics and weapons as in CFS1.  Terrain is a huge improvement, but the graphics quality of the aircraft is not.  Smoking effects are an improvement (the kind you get when you mortally wound an enemy plane) but the sound/graphics related to enemy bullets is completely unconvincing (bullets sound as if they're whizzing past you, even while punching holes through your Hellcat).  The naval aviation aspects of CFS2 are also a mixed bag between "wow" and "huh?!"  On the one hand, ships actually move (not like the perpetually parked steamers and U-Boats of CFS1) and even bob.  On the other hand, the sim doesn't let you fly the planes that flew anti-shipping strikes: dive bombers and torpedoe planes like the TBF or SBD, and none of your flyable planes are armed with torpedoes.  Though ships are an improvement over those in CFS1, that's not saying much.  While ships in CFS2 now burn, and even stop dead in the water before sinking, (rather than just disappear in a puff of polygon-fire) they otherwise slip quietly, and whole, beneath the Pacific - never breaking apart, listing or disgorging fuel or men like the game's planes (or those in "Their Finest Hour" of 1989).  Your own aircraft carrier remains curiously pristine (considering how they were magnets for enemy planes) but also devoid of any activity - human or mechanical - unlike the airfields of CFS1.  To help you land, there's an LSO (Landing Signal Officer), but he appears, not on the carrier, but in the "radar" window on your left side.  Looking much like the AOL stick-figure, I can't imagine this guy guiding anybody up the gangplank, let alone talking a landing airplane onto the wire.  (I've become proficient at carrier landings despite getting a "WAVE-OFF!" on every approach).  He doesn't even speak - the LSO has a pretty finite number of phrases ("wave-off", "power", "raise altitude" or "you're too high" to think of a few).  A talking LSO was a fixture of "F-14 Fleet Defender" (1994).  Not that carrier-flying isn't a welcome challenge, it's just painfully obvious that nobody explored the cool ways to make the most of it.  Campaigns are pre-scripted, though dynamic campaigns would probably be wasted on a sim of this type.  That doesn't excuse an unnecessarily rigid mission requirement system that won't allow you to "jump" once you're out of ammo or damaged.  That itself was not as problematic as the alternative - I was willing to fly back to my carrier in real time, only to find that the in-flight map brought me back to where my carrier had been when I launched, not where it had gotten to about 2 hours later!In short, CFS2 is more of a game-engine than completed game.  Likely, you can fill in the gaps described above with third-party software on the internet.  But it's an insult that CFS2 is so far short of its potential out of the box.  I bought the newer game because I expected more than an evolved form of CFS1 (I could've gotten that myself).  That's a shame, because the sim itself is such a beaut - one in which those interested enough can learn about the mechanics of WWII engines, face the challenge of carrier-landing battle-damaged planes or triumph over the supremely nimble Japanese planes using dive-and-zoom techniques (rather than trying to out-turn them as pilots will try by instinct).  It wasn't until I reached mid-1944 that I encountered clouds - but they were beautiful.  For its faults, CFS2 is that rare sim that keeps you coming back, and goes to lengths to keep you out of "slew" mode.I ran CFS 2 on a P4-2Ghz, WinXP w/game port controls.  Graphics were acceptably fluid and there were no controllability problems, though load times are high.  If you haven't bought any WWII sims since the mid-90's, I'd suggest this one.  Otherwise, you'll have to weigh your interest in WWII naval aviation against the price of this one and your eagerness to have to customize a sim in ways you'd expect it to behave out of the box.

This is the original CFS.  Though CFS3 is out by now, those owning older computers, even those that can run CFS2, should consider CFS1 as an alternative.  CFS1 is set in Europe - allowing you to fly fighter missions using the tried and true Microsoft Flight Simulator engine (formerly the BAO flight sim engine).  Surprisingly, this is a pretty effective sim for one that many could easily boil down to "Flight simulator with guns".  Unfortunately, despite the challenges of adapting skills amassed flying combat flight sims with less realistic flight modeling, CFS1 never really becomes more than "Flight simulator with guns".In CFS1, you can fly on-line, single missions, or campaigns.  Using the MSFS engine, it is as adaptable as any edition of "Microsoft Flight Simulator" in terms of add-on aircraft, scenery or missions.  (Be aware, that while there's no shortage of modern military aircraft available for sale or for download, the inherenent design of this game is towards pre-modern aircraft.  Neither the sophisticated systems nor guided weapons are available).  There are actually 2 campaigns - the Battle of Britain (summer of 1940) in which you intercept (or escort) waves of the Luftwaffe's medium level bombers or dive bombers against industrial and defense targets in England or Channel shipping and the daylight bombing campaign against Europe starting around 1943.  CFS1 is entirely a fighter-driven game - barring user customization, you can't fly big bombers.  On the flip side, fighters can be armed with rockets or bombs.  While you can fly for the Luftwaffe in either campaign, your choice on the allied side is limited.  I can understand being stuck with the RAF for the Battle of Britain (the attack on Pearl, and America's entry into the war was still over a year away), but didn't the RAF fly at all in 1943-45?  The campaigns are short and scripted: you fly the same mission until you get it right.  To be honest, the mission goals aren't demanding (I'm more likely to get snagged by crashing into a wingman or getting too close to an enemy), and the repetitive aspect of pre-scripted missions would be little improved by a dynamic campaign, since most missions would be the same anyway (how much of a Mustang pilot's time wasn't spent escorting waves of B-17's?).  One tip for escorting the bombers - you may have caught Edmund O'Brien as a P-47 driver in "Fighter Squadron" (1948) who chafes under rules that require his pilots to stick with the bombers and not chase enemy planes to the deck.  Just remember, the time you've spent after you break formation to chase an Me-109 away, will easily be exceeded by how long it will take you to rejoin, especially if you went for the deck and must now claw back up to your formation's flight level.  This is especially critical since other Me-109s will exploit your absence to cut into your formations.  Stick with the bombers!I can't say how realistic flight modeling was - I'd expected worse remembering how pitiful I was on the WWI mission included on the original BAO Flight Sim (c. 1982).  Visually, the planes are lovely, though this is an old game, and it won't bowl you over.  Damage modeling is suspect - CFS1 is stuck in an era of sims in which your plane will have a fixed response to damage; this is despite a more effective damage model in "Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe" (1990) in which a given hit from an enemy will lead to progressive deterioration in your plane's condition.  Ground targets and ships are completely implausible - one hit from your rockets and destroyers, u-boats and merchantmen (which remain parked like sitting ducks) disappear in fireballs ala "Battlestar Galactica", which hints that this project was rushed to shelves.  (The other hint is the appearance of Me-262 jets - they only appear in one mission, and as ground targets.  How did that happen?)So, what's really wrong?  A weak mission generator and the same aircraft we've seen in over ten years in flight sims.  MS probably guessed that it wasn't worth their time to do more than add guns and damage models to the FS engine - people would just download the missions, flight panels, scenery or aircraft files they wanted anyway.  Sure the game has the big planes of that theater of the war - but then did CFS1 have to wartime Europe?  With its flight engine, CFS1 would have been the perfect vehicle for a Korean war sim - an idea that MS inexplicably ignored for this and the next 2 additions.  WWII Europe simply has been simmed to death.  Terrain is incredibly flat and, especially down low, doesn't even look like terrain.  It's almost at the point where, unless you go on the `net for add-on files, there really isn't anything to simulate here.  In short, MS was hot to create a military flight sim that would adapt to any user's preference, they forgot to give it features that people would prefer to keep.  I couldn't get decent performance on my P200mmx/Voodoo2 PC.  Obviously, hardware wasn't an issue when I moved up to a P4 (no Windows XP compatibility issues here).On a final note, CFS1's disappointments are not completely covered by CFS2.  I own both games since I wanted a Pacific war sim.  Though CFS2 is obviously an improvement, CFS1 holds up pretty well - CFS1 owners can download or buy add-on files to capture the Pacific experience.  In short, if you've got CFS1, don't feel like you've got to spend $$ for CFS2 or to upgrade your machine.

In the early days of computing, a small UK outfit called Bullfrog made some of the most groundbreaking 'God' games ever; Populous and Powermonger being the most memorable. Years pass and Bullfrog releases several incarnations of various god games culminating in their rebirth as "Lionhead" and the release of "Black and White", a PC god game with a tamagotchi pet gimmick. As with most of this company's games, a 'good versus evil' element comes into play allowing the player to choose a path of righteousness.But in their latest release 'Fable', aside from your character's visual appearance, things don't really change much between good and bad. Spells and equipment, as well as armour and weapons are useable equally regardless of your moral alignment. And you will also be able to realign yourself whenever you choose - in fact the game sort of forces you to with some quests requiring adjusting your good alignment and others bad. This in turn, makes the touted 'you decide' factor somewhat moot.So that leaves us with a adventure romp which, whilst initially fun, is so ridden with horrible foibles that I simply gained little enjoyment from it. Sure it looks real purty and the day to night gradual transition is very effective but the game limits you to very specific vicinities - no free roaming here. In fact, even though you can walk in some water, other areas are inexplicably out of bounds - some ponds are surrounded by invisible walls, tiny bonsai bushes are impenetrable. So you're looking at a nice faux postcard whose appearance belies boundaries that have little baring on where you can go. Shame.Sound is great - until a character talks. They have used the most annoying amateurish UK v/o artists imaginable. If you're a Brit it might be fun to hear the regional dialects - but for the rest of us it's incoherent babble. They didn't even confine accents to areas giving off a sense of locale. Instead each character is gifted with a random unattractive nasal twang from regions unknown.Moving from location to location brings up the next most problematic part of Fable. Load times. Areas are specifically loaded - no preloading or streaming. So if you go through a gate, under an arch or pass a tree the loading screen pops up. And stays there. Some areas are no more than a single cave or corridor yet you have to endure the same loading time - often it takes longer for an area to load than it does to travel across. Sure you can teleport to certain important areas but travelling on foot is an exersize in patience. Have something to read with you when playing.The storyline is common fare - family wiped out seemingly with you as the only survivor, you seek revenge of the killer(s) and knowledge from those who raise you. The cutscenes vary from interesting to tedious - most of the dialogue is terrible with unexplainable pausing between delivery. You can skip them of course, but as a player I want to know what's going on, what I'm supposed to do. So I sit there whilst unanimated manniquins talk at you. And boy is it dull -"Oh there you are (pause)... I thought you were dead (pause)... I'm glad you aren't (pause)... Will you help me (pause)... I think I'll need some help (pause)..." and on and on and on.Combat is frustrating and magic is unuseable during battle since you can't pause combat to reassess your magic powers or change them to make them more applicable. I completed most of the game with 'Lightening' - I didn't both seeking out alternative powers since Lightening seemed to do the trick and changing spells during a fight was clumsy to the max.So yeah I didn't like it. It wasn't for me. In summation; nothing new here and vastly overhyped and simply not that much fun.Sorry Bullfrog but Populous is turning over in its 80s grave.
In the early days of computing, a small UK outfit called Bullfrog made some of the most groundbreaking 'God' games ever; Populous and Powermonger being the most memorable. Years pass and Bullfrog releases several incarnations of various god games culminating in their rebirth as "Lionhead" and the release of "Black and White", a PC god game with a tamagotchi pet gimmick. As with most of this company's games, a 'good versus evil' element comes into play allowing the player to choose a path of righteousness.But in their latest release 'Fable', aside from your character's visual appearance, things don't really change much between good and bad. Spells and equipment, as well as armour and weapons are useable equally regardless of your moral alignment. And you will also be able to realign yourself whenever you choose - in fact the game sort of forces you to with some quests requiring adjusting your good alignment and others bad. This in turn, makes the touted 'you decide' factor somewhat moot.So that leaves us with a adventure romp which, whilst initially fun, is so ridden with horrible foibles that I simply gained little enjoyment from it. Sure it looks real purty and the day to night gradual transition is very effective but the game limits you to very specific vicinities - no free roaming here. In fact, even though you can walk in some water, other areas are inexplicably out of bounds - some ponds are surrounded by invisible walls, tiny bonsai bushes are impenetrable. So you're looking at a nice faux postcard whose appearance belies boundaries that have little baring on where you can go. Shame.Sound is great - until a character talks. They have used the most annoying amateurish UK v/o artists imaginable. If you're a Brit it might be fun to hear the regional dialects - but for the rest of us it's incoherent babble. They didn't even confine accents to areas giving off a sense of locale. Instead each character is gifted with a random unattractive nasal twang from regions unknown.Moving from location to location brings up the next most problematic part of Fable. Load times. Areas are specifically loaded - no preloading or streaming. So if you go through a gate, under an arch or pass a tree the loading screen pops up. And stays there. Some areas are no more than a single cave or corridor yet you have to endure the same loading time - often it takes longer for an area to load than it does to travel across. Sure you can teleport to certain important areas but travelling on foot is an exersize in patience.

For those of you out there who played (and loved) 'Privateer' with the speech pack, Freelancer will be a disappointment. Despite it's positive features, such as fluent gameplay and an expansive universe (to name a couple), Freelancer is missing the humour and 'homely-feel', if you will, of it's antecedent.In Privateer, you would encounter Retros who yelled &quot;heathen taste riteous fire!&quot;, pirates with Texan accents (&quot;this crate's about to explode!&quot;), Kilrathi, confeds, bounty hunters, militia and aliens. Even better, you could communicate with them. You could ask them how they were or if they needed help; or you could insult them,  provoking them into a fight or persuading them not to attack you. This feature added enormously to the feel of Privateer - it truly felt as if you were part of a rich environment.Conversely, Freelancer lacks this option entirely. Enemies are faceless and numerous. 'Rogues' are simply that - rogues. They have no discernible character. In fact, it's the same with all enemies in the game. This makes each journey into space something of a bore. It's just a matter of take off, fly to the way-point, take out the enemies, etc. etc.Worse still, the in-game cinematics are perhaps the dullest cutscenes ever made. 'Trent', the Freelancer you play, is as boring as he is monotone. The rest of the characters are as well. In Freelancer's future, personality apparantly has devolved out of humanity entirely. In Privateer, you would meet interesting characters with whom an interplay would develop. There was a spark about the repartee.Despite how pedantic all this may sound (I too would be skeptical of a criticism of a game that's based entirely on character), it's incredible how much the game suffers as a result. Other reviews will tell you the game is well made, looks good, feels good, and plays well. It is all these things, without a doubt. But when you enter the world of Freelancer, you enter an entirely functional, and dull, gaming environment.

I would like to be able to write a review for Mech Commander 2, but I am unable to play this game on any computer in my house. It seems that Microsoft has chosen to add a copy-protect program-- &quot;SafeDisc&quot;-- to render the CD-ROM incompatible with every single drive I have. A readme file included with Mech Commander warns the user of this problem, when it is too late.Unfortunately, Microsoft neither includes a warning on the box, nor posts a list of incompatible drives on the Web-- as of this writing. Those who have not yet purchased Mech Commander 2 should be aware that, among many other drives, the CD-ROM fails with the following: Sony CDU5211, Sony CDU77E, Acer CD-624a, Memorex CD-RW2224, Plextor CD-ROM PX-32TS (SCSI), Sanyo CRD-256P, and the Yamaha 2216E, 4416SX, and CDR6416S-VK. The full list is probably much longer. Microsoft does indicate that the Sony CDU77E should work if it is configured as a master drive, but all of the others listed are right out.I am personally going to contact Mircosoft about getting a replacement disc. I suspect a patch will not arrive, since this is a hardware issue, and Microsoft obviously will not do anything to override a system they just spent money to install and distribute. It may behoove the reader to write Microsoft for a full list of incompatible drives.

Kuju entertainment developed this game for Microsoft, and it lives up to its name. You can explore six different historical railroads, including Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, Burlington Northern's Marias Pass route, and a section of the Orient Express in Austria. Two Japanese lines and the Flying Scottsman are also available. The graphics are beautiful and the sounds are faithfully reproduced. Microphones were mounted on various areas of each engine to capture the sounds of accelerating, braking, etc. The steam trains thunder and wheeze, the diesels hum, and the electrics quietly click along. The scenery includes trees, bridges, roads, moving automobiles, and tall mountains that actually look appropriately scaled -- a rare feat with today's computer games.However, make sure you have a mid-range system or better if you want to be able to run this game. Slower PCs, such as those of 500Mhz or under, will probably not be able to display high levels of detail without slowing the system to unacceptable levels. Also, be sure you have a capable video card. If you don't have enough system or video horsepower, you should upgrade your system before installing. Also, the full install requires 1.8 gigabytes of hard drive space -- not exactly a small footprint.Driving a train for the first time is thrilling. The game lets you look at the trains from an almost infinite number of angles, and they certainly look good! Learning to brake was also quite a challenge. Trying to stop a 30-car train on a steep grade in the rain gave me new respect for what engineers do on a daily basis.However, after playing the game for two weeks, I must relunctantly conclude that this game is only for hardcore train fans. Once I had mastered braking and could get to stations on time, the game quickly ceased to be interesting. I'm just not interested by backing my train into a siding at 5 MPH to pick up some grain cars. I don't think it's fun to have to drive a train at 12 MPH in a reduced-speed zone for 10 minutes of real time. While this game faithfully simulates real-life railroading conditions, I'm afraid that this doesn't translate to gaming excitement.I'm not knocking railroad fans, and I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy learning how to drive trains. But despite the excellent technological achievements showcased by this game, unless you are a die-hard train fan, I'd advise against buying this product. It simply doesn't provide enough entertainment for your money, especially since the replay value appears limited. There IS an editor included with the game, but at this writing it seems buggy and is not particularly easy to use. Perhaps that will change in the future. Additional user-made maps and scenarios would definitely help to make this game a better value.

This isn't a game...it's an evil entity from you-know-where....it's come to take over the human race...and it's succeeding...it almost got me. I rented it, then realized within minutes that I was playing a clump of manure, not a "superb and divine game experience". I truly believed that RPGs saved me...if you find your psyche being taken over by this evil, feverish disease known as "Halo", quickly play FFVII or Chrono Cross. It's the only cure. And now, the evil entity has devised a way to clone itself. That's right, Halo 2 is upon us, and the foolish public still hasn't wised up. Run while you still can, dear reader. You may think you're too clever to be tricked by evil, but this is such a twisted machination that it even made Game Informer its mindless puppet. If you must have an FPS, buy Metroid Prime...Nintendo is the only savior from the demon-spawn that is Halo.

realmente ha cumplido el objetivo , me parecio que esta muy practico para pasar un buen rato de descanso. lo malo es que es lenta la lectura del juego y se pierde mucho tiempo en esa espera.
Me and my homes were playin dis game, and at first, it seemed why this game was perhaps the Xbox E3 game of the year, but my homes shouda listend to gamespot, but he didn't and the game got frustrating down da road, basicly on controls, and and time sweepin, and the story is rather dull, and we were lookin up stratagy guides to find an easier way to go on on this part, but we had to look up reel good, and it took us a while to beat this game.  Frustrating, but fun going through the levels, cuz my friend basicly did all the work.  So I recomend this game to people looking 4 a frustratin challange that'll make em' slam their controller, others, maybe a rent.Peace

I've never considered myself a real-time strategist. Since Westwood's seminal *Dune II*, I've beaten about every major RTS on the American market. Yet game play hasn't evolved enough to sustain my interest.Same goes for turned-based strategy, though I've been clicking "Next Turn" since the original *Civilization*. These too, have stuck by the formula with insufficient innovations to maintain replay value.So when PC journalists began to herald an RTS/TBS revolution last year, I took notice. Developer Big Huge Games and game 'zines alike trumpeted a game to bridge the gap between the excitement and mechanics of real-time war games with the scope and sophistication of turned-based empire builders.Folks, I am still waiting. In the meantime, I received Big Huge Games' *Rise of Nations*; beneath all the hype it's a disappointingly conventional RTS.&lt;Build, and They Will Rush&gt;From the get-go, it's necessary to sort game from advertisement. Favorable reviewers all around have gushed some variation of the following:1. *RoN* is a sophisticated RTS.2. *RoN* is an epic RTS.3. *RoN* is a hybrid between RTS and TBS game types.4. *RoN* is a sophisticated, epic hybrid between RTS and TBS types.While I haven't tested these claims online, my single-player conquests invalidated these claims.*RoN* rigidly adheres to RTS tradition. Gameplay confines to the B3 principle: Build bases, Build units, Blow up. The developers include a Risk-style "Conquer the World" mode which offers raiding party actions, but otherwise missions are solved by building a base, amassing resources, and then smashing a computer-controlled base with a large, clumsy army. Like most modern RTS games, *RoN* offers rudimentary diplomacy, research, and economic features to upgrade your forces. Likewise, it offers a choice of combatants distinguished mainly by military power and texture skins variations. Finally, *RoN* arrays stereotypical unit types and superfluous gimmicks... like most RTS games, the player will quickly learn that building a bunch of tanks and rushing the enemy base works most of the time.*RoN* rushes with Blizzard-style play mechanics founded back with the original *Warcraft*. Players use a central building to generate labor units, units who mine a small range of archetypal resources from battlemap hotspots and typically hoof them back to the central building (though *RoN* mercifully permits players to build collection camps on-site). Players then spend these resources by ordering labor units to build factories, laboratories, and fortifications around the central building. Each has its own build queue for military units, and/or unit upgrades as well.Bases are not sprawling, well-defend affairs as in the Westwood model. Fortifications lack sufficient range and hit points while costing too much to build; discouraging base-camping and encouraging aggressive play. One usually wins by destroying selected enemy buildings. A 200-unit population cap per player constrains their entire infrastructures.Frankly, I find this game-style dated. That doesn't stop Big Huge Games from trying to adorn their product with trappings of the turned-based empire genre. *RoN* notably introduces a "library" of additional building and unit upgrades. This library also improves caps and modifiers for resources, and improves the next notable introduction, national borders. National borders act strictly as a weapon, by inflicting "attrition" damage on any enemy unit or building caught on the wrong side of a shift. Per *Civilization*, a number of "wonder" buildings unlock special powers and modifications. And the players can advance through levels of technology called "Ages". BHG emulates Stainless Steel Studios in offering peaceful technology or resource races as an endgame option for skirmish and multiplayer modes.And that's it. Big Huge Games might call its combatants "civilizations", its labor units "citizens", and its bases "cities"; in practice it's still the Blizzard RTS military model. The intricate tech trees of the *Civ* and *MOO* series are here trimmed down to lines of yet more unit upgrades. Borders have no cultural or political purpose-they just act as a force shield. Economy is still a shallow matter of collecting resources and uncovering crates to build powerful armies. Missions are limited mostly to combat, the non-military options being woefully underdeveloped. Yes, *Rise of Nations* is straight RTS, no more sophisticated than *Starcraft* or epic than *Empire Earth*.&lt;Rise Above&gt;With *RoN* put into perspective, I can see its virtues more clearly. It's a fast-paced entry into the "historical" genre, for those who want to upgrade armies from the stone age to modern times in an afternoon. A plethora of civilization-specific units and advantages lends a style choice to whichever side you play. BHG keeps base buildings to a minimum, and players can immediately build all units available for a given age, so long as they have the resources and the factories. Resources are widely available and players have plenty of room on each map to spread their bases and amass armies. BHG also incorporates good unit AI and path-finding. If the player doesn't want to worry about an extended campaign or story-line, *RoN* is all about skirmishes and multiplayer.&lt;Fall of Nations&gt;Perhaps as much as the hype these traditions fail to please me. I'm tired of the arbitrary 200-unit population caps and mindless B3 routine. Westwood games may be even more dated in their play mechanics, but at least they concentrated each game on a story and well-executed themes, instead of developing a loose collection of skirmish variations beneath a thread-bare claim of being "historical".BHG could have broke the mold; the idea of a true epic RTS is one of the great unrealized ideas in PC gaming. They played it safe instead-but had the gall to call it something it is not. Make no mistake; dedicated RTS gamers will probably love this game for the same reasons I dislike it. But serious TBS gamers may be disappointed all around. *Rise of Nations* is no real-time *Civilization*; it's as conventional a military RTS as they come. Just don't buy the hype if you buy this game.
I've never considered myself a real-time strategist. Since Westwood's seminal *Dune II*, I've beaten about every major RTS on the American market. Yet game play hasn't evolved enough to sustain my interest.Same goes for turned-based strategy, though I've been clicking "Next Turn" since the original *Civilization*. These too, have stuck by the formula with insufficient innovations to maintain replay value.So when PC journalists began to herald an RTS/TBS revolution last year, I took notice. Developer Big Huge Games and game 'zines alike trumpeted a game to bridge the gap between the excitement and mechanics of real-time war games with the scope and sophistication of turned-based empire builders.Folks, I am still waiting. In the meantime, I received Big Huge Games' *Rise of Nations*; beneath all the hype it's a disappointingly conventional RTS.&lt;Build, and They Will Rush&gt;From the get-go, it's necessary to sort game from advertisement. Favorable reviewers all around have gushed some variation of the following:1. *RoN* is a sophisticated RTS.2. *RoN* is an epic RTS.3. *RoN* is a hybrid between RTS and TBS game types.4. *RoN* is a sophisticated, epic hybrid between RTS and TBS types.While I haven't tested these claims online, my single-player conquests invalidated these claims.*RoN* rigidly adheres to RTS tradition. Gameplay confines to the B3 principle: Build bases, Build units, Blow up. The developers include a Risk-style "Conquer the World" mode which offers raiding party actions, but otherwise missions are solved by building a base, amassing resources, and then smashing a computer-controlled base with a large, clumsy army. Like most modern RTS games, *RoN* offers rudimentary diplomacy, research, and economic features to upgrade your forces. Likewise, it offers a choice of combatants distinguished mainly by military power and texture skins variations. Finally, *RoN* arrays stereotypical unit types and superfluous gimmicks... like most RTS games, the player will quickly learn that building a bunch of tanks and rushing the enemy base works most of the time.*RoN* rushes with Blizzard-style play mechanics founded back with the original *Warcraft*. Players use a central building to generate labor units, units who mine a small range of archetypal resources from battlemap hotspots and typically hoof them back to the central building (though *RoN* mercifully permits players to build collection camps on-site). Players then spend these resources by ordering labor units to build factories, laboratories, and fortifications around the central building. Each has its own build queue for military units, and/or unit upgrades as well.Bases are not sprawling, well-defend affairs as in the Westwood model. Fortifications lack sufficient range and hit points while costing too much to build; discouraging base-camping and encouraging aggressive play. One usually wins by destroying selected enemy buildings. A 200-unit population cap per player constrains their entire infrastructures.Frankly, I find this game-style dated. That doesn't stop Big Huge Games from trying to adorn their product with trappings of the turned-based empire genre. *RoN* notably introduces a "library" of additional building and unit upgrades. This library also improves caps and modifiers for resources, and improves the next notable introduction, national borders. National borders act strictly as a weapon, by inflicting "attrition" damage on any enemy unit or building caught on the wrong side of a shift. Per *Civilization*, a number of "wonder" buildings unlock special powers and modifications. And the players can advance through levels of technology called "Ages". BHG emulates Stainless Steel Studios in offering peaceful technology or resource races as an endgame option for skirmish and multiplayer modes.And that's it. Big Huge Games might call its combatants "civilizations", its labor units "citizens", and its bases "cities"; in practice it's still the Blizzard RTS military model. The intricate tech trees of the *Civ* and *MOO* series are here trimmed down to lines of yet more unit upgrades. Borders have no cultural or political purpose-they just act as a force shield. Economy is still a shallow matter of collecting resources and uncovering crates to build powerful armies. Missions are limited mostly to combat, the non-military options being woefully underdeveloped. Yes, *Rise of Nations* is straight RTS, no more sophisticated than *Starcraft* or epic than *Empire Earth*.&lt;Rise Above&gt;With *RoN* put into perspective, I can see its virtues more clearly. It's a fast-paced entry into the "historical" genre, for those who want to upgrade armies from the stone age to modern times in an afternoon. A plethora of civilization-specific units and advantages lends a style choice to whichever side you play. BHG keeps base buildings to a minimum, and players can immediately build all units available for a given age, so long as they have the resources and the factories. Resources are widely available and players have plenty of room on each map to spread their bases and amass armies. BHG also incorporates good unit AI and path-finding.

Looking like a 3D Age of Empires with three separate races almost as different as to be like Starcraft, Age of Mythology had potential to be a great game.Despite being an old game of only 1.5 gigabytes or so, the game ran smoothly, with units moving in formation automatically, looking quite smooth and small.  It is still gratifying to see villagers hit a tree with a few axe hits, then see the thing keel over and stay on the ground until it's been fully chopped, or to see dying units stay on the field, gradually disintegrating into corpses, then into nothing.There's nothing wrong at all with the engine or the animation or anything.  It was fun and highly entertaining.  The thing that drags this game down is where all strategy games should shine their brightest: combat.A single Greek Hoplite takes up 2 population points, with each house providing 15 population points, each town center about 15-20 (I forget) and you receiving a limit of 10 houses on a map, and only as many town centers as there are villages on the map (which as as sparingly placed as gold mines), so you're never likely to have an army bigger than a few dozen units at a time.But you're never likely to get 50-60 or even 100 units on the field at once.  The higher up you progress on the unit scale, the more population each unit eats up.  None of the units is particularly effective against other units save to bash at them for a minute or so before their target dies.The mixing of mythology and reality in the game is almost seamless, but there's still a sense of disbelief to it, and when even the most basic Myth unit overpowers some of the toughest Human units, it pretty much becomes a literal "Age of Mythology"Battles will be decided mostly by myth units.  It doesn't matter if you've amassed an army of hundreds of basic infantry, because a wave of Colossi, or Dragons, or Anubites, or a spell like Meteor, Lightning storm, etc will wipe them out in minutes if they are in big enough number.God powers are another thing that are grossly overpowered.  While it's absolutely beautiful watching meteor strike smack into an enemy base and leave giant craters while temporarily flooding the area with light, it's a bit much to see almost the entire selected patch of an enemy base crumbling before a single meteor strike or earthquake or whatever.  Granted, you can only use this godpower once per level, but who needs to use it more than once?Myth units get progressively stronger as you upgrade and select different Gods to worship and gain their respective powers, upgrades, and myth units, but in the end all infantry and cavalry are rendered useless before the might of the myth units.  The same problem that plagued Red Alert 2 plagues this game.Goods:- Simple, yet smooth and beautiful graphics make the game fun to watch.- A complex array of units awaits those who wish to fight with humans rather than myth units.- Units speak their native languages (Greeks speak ancient Greek, Egyptians speak ancient Egyptian, Norse speak some sort of Scandinavian).- Easy and steady interface makes it user-friendly and not a mad rush for resources or a mad rush for infantry.  Slow and steady could actually win you the race, if you're playing wisely.Neutral:- Myth units are a bit garish in their style and size.- God powers can be used only once, which is good for some (like meteor or earthquake) and bad for others.- Buildings can take a long time to break down, requiring siege equipmentBad:- Myth units are grossly overpowered, and render human infantry useless once into the midst of the game.- Strict population limits and high unit population cost means combat will be limited and no more than 80 units can be fielded by one side at a time.- Repetitive nature of Myth units and God powers makes replayability a myth in itself.- God powers are souped up superweapons, with an earthquake capable of leveling an entire enemy base of all its buildings save for town centers, fortresses, and other heavier buildings.All in all, it was a fun game to play at first, but replayability is not a realistic thought.  Myth units dominate the game (which some would argue they should, being as the name of the game is "Age of Mythology", but it does so at the cost of human infantry entirely).  If myth units are designed to be the elite in this game, why bother with so much work on an extensive and quite complex selection of human infantry/cavalry?That appears to be my only major problem, but it's a big one.

Okay, so I'm supposed to build buildings and units.  Got it.  Wait, I'm also supposed to walk around and discover rarities that merchants can harvest.  Got it.  Wait, I'm also supposed to accumulate wood, food, &amp; gold.  Got it.  Wait, I'm also supposed to study in the library AND (and this is the part that bugs me most) in every other building.  AND. I'm also supposed to build an army/navy and deploy them in a micromanaging way.  This game has some great parts - I am not denying that.  However, it is a horribly flawed nightmare.  I loved to micromanage in turn-based strategies.  It is next to impossible to accomplish this in a RTS.  I feel torn between wanting to research, build, gather, and explore.  I defy anyone finding an enjoyable balance.  Rise of Nations would be far supperior if it were turn-based.  As it is, I constantly feel as though I'm neglecting one of my four desires.  Also, it is ridiculous to be required to research advancements in multiple buildings.  It sounds organized at first but it becomes a nightmare when trying to stay on top of technology advances.  Developers should make ONE research interface!  Second, units should not build buildings!  Cities should build buildings!  Do not make me responsible for creating a citizen.  This makes no sense.  Buildings a military unit makes tons of sense, but not normal citizens!!!  I am begging the developers to redesign the city interface to encompass these changes!  These minor changes would make this game fanastic.

(Having never owned "Links 386" -the first installment of the critically-acclaimed Links series- Links LS (1996) was the first Links golf game that I ever purchased and when I did it totally blew me away: I was in awe of the awesome photorealistic graphics and the incredibly-realistic ball flight and ball-surface physics. The golfers were also photorealistic digital images. The game was a die-hard sim, yet extremely fun and accessible at the same time. I was instantly hooked on LS and as a result I've played more hours of this game and its sequels than all other computer games combined, by far.Up until several days ago, LS 99 was my current version of Links. I was unable to upgrade to LS 2000 (I was out of the country) or Links 2001. Which brings me to my first "upgrade" in four years -Links 2003. After having played the game extensively for several days now, I have very mixed feelings about this newest installment. In some ways it seems significantly improved over LS 99, but in just as many ways it seems to be substantially inferior. Because I wish to expound upon every component in this dissertation, I've decided to simply list the Pros and Cons.PROS1. The graphics are more 3D and much more detailed than LS's: The shrubbery and foilage around trees and roughs is very detailed, photorealistic, and very dense. With a close-up view of your golfer, you can now see detailed blades of grass in fairways and greens. Sand bunkers look great.2. The addition of the APCD (Arnold Palmer Course Designer) is huge: From my understanding, although it's very complicated and not beginner-oriented, it's hands-down the most powerful course designer in any golf game.3. The addition of the real-time swing: I've sampled this feature in other golf games and liked the concept but not the implementation. Likewise, I've had little luck with Link's implementation as well and have found it tedious and extraordinarily difficult.4. A plethora of golf courses: Betwixt the 6 2003 courses, the 20 Championship courses, user courses(from Links 2001 made with the APCD), and my converted LS courses, I have 60 altogether!5. Options galore: As with LS 99 there are simply smorgasbords of options.6. Excellent in-flight and ball-surface physics: Links has always been the benchmark in this category and this year is no different. No other game comes close.CONS1. No Virtual Tournament: This was a huge reason why I played LS so much.2. Fairways, greens, and roughs are "too" clean looking -to the point of being "spartan"- and look like artificial turf. The ball even bounces and rolls off roughs like it's a thick layer of artificial turf. It even "sounds" like it.3. Big, cluttered menu interface: The condensed and organized interface of LS 99 makes 2003's look like a homecrafted Kindergarten design.4. Extremely ponderous load times: On my 1.7 Ghz processor, screen redraws take forever, adding another camera view on the main window slows the framerate down to a nil, and even jumping from one pregame menu to another takes a long time. Totally unacceptable.5. Polygonal golfers: I actually prefer digital golfers. These polygonal ones look cartoonish and clash with Link's otherwise photorealism. A motley combination.6. Unrealistically adept A.I. golfers: Real-life A.I. counterparts such as Sergio Garcia and Parnevik hit every drive straight and birdie every hole. Microsoft did a shamefully-poor job in this area. Even when I created a new computer golfer and set his skill level to the lowest possible, he was still a decent golfer.Overall, Links 2003 is very mixed baggage. In several ways it seems to be a (close copy) rehash of "Jack Nicklaus 6: Golden Bear Challenge": The fairways, greens, and roughs are more cartoony-looking, the golfers are polygonal and cartoonish (while Links LS's were digital), and most notably, some surface and tree striking sounds are now less realistic and cheesier -similar to Jack Nicklaus 6. The swing meter and other features even seem inferior and (close copy) from JN6.All things considered, Links 2003 is a very good golf game on its own merits and still the best golf SIM, but with its major shortcomings and horrendously-implemented real-time swing I'm still ambivalent as to whether this latest installment is an "upgrade" or a "downgrade."

Great game and everything I've come to expect from a good RTS...with one problem.  Everytime you're attacked off screen, a trumpet call sounds.  It almost sounds like you're getting a text message.  Well this game is basically one big battle, so the trumpet call goes off about once every five or six seconds on average.  Now imagine a level that takes you forty minutes to complete.  The ENTIRE time you're playing its playing what sounds like the first four notes of the FFVII victory tune.  Bah bah bah bah....bah bah bah bah.....bah bah bah bah..."Sir we need re enforcements on...bah bah bah bah....the main gate"....bah bah bah bah....bah bah bah bah......bah bah bah bah....."get those archers on...bah bah bah bah.....those tower units"  bah bah bah bah.  I uninstalled the game after about ten minutes because there's no way to turn this feature off unless you turn off all sound.
As the opening cutscene introduces you to Blinx the cat, the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures, I found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story. The idea is that a secret, off-world clan of humanoid cat creatures, armed with souped up vacuum cleaners, are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map. It seems that time, when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats, takes the form of one of five different brightly-colored shapes. If these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things, they turn into monsters. I could go on, because the game certainly doesn't stop there, but I think you get the point.I like to think that there's a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super-detailed realism. Generally, a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game, because they're almost exclusively set in a photorealistic, lifelike location. Cartoons, on the other hand, generally don't worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time. How much fun would the Wile E. Coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate, it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics? Blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that's overly detail-centric in an environment that's right out of a kid's show. The result is a tale that comes off as way, WAY out of left field and almost completely abstract. It focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer's imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way.Beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world, how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear, the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic. There's a princess, evil pigs have kidnapped her, and it's up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world. That's it, no side-stories, no reasoning, no subplots - just a straightforward rush from Point A to Point B. And here I thought the phrase "save the princess" was universally recognized as an ages-old cliche.Now, I don't want it to sound like I'm railing on this game just because it's got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor. It's also completely lacking in character development, general storytelling and ongoing inspiration. None of the characters in Blinx really establish themselves as individuals, including the lead character himself. You don't hate the pig on the spaceship because he's trying to destroy the world, you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money. I honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three, because she's never mentioned between the game's start and its finish. I mean, the very first Super Mario Brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight.I don't honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging. The first level and a half are set up in the standard "get to know you" format, with the simplest of enemies, the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools. Shortly thereafter, you're thrown to the wolves. For the most part, the level designs are very short, with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge. I noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts, whether it's retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk (har har) above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point. You'll almost always know what needs to be done, but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick. I just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is. If there's a bottomless pit nearby, (and chances are very good that there is) Blinx will find a way to force himself into it, regardless of what you're hitting on the control pad. If there's an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button, he'll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room, rather than the imminent threat.That's not to say that the entirety of The Time Sweeper is totally without merit, because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table, but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings. The ability to control time, for instance, was at the time a really fresh, interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today, despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged. You can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge, pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time, knock the level into slow motion, etc. All the while, Blinx is moving around in real time. It's a great idea, but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized. Why can't I use two controls at the same time? Why don't more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers? Why doesn't the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause, speed up or rewind when I use my time powers? Why is their duration so brief, and why can't I hold more than a dozen uses at a time? I mean, this could've really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer.The controls, too, are an undeveloped, undertested nightmare. Blinx himself is often sluggish to respond, especially when implementing his time controls. He has difficulty making a precise turn, whether on midair or on solid ground. He stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item, which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks. He routinely moves in the direction of certain death, as though pulled by a magnetic field, whether you've instructed him to do so or not. He'll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump, particularly when attempting a difficult, precise leap across a gaping chasm.I think it's these controls that most make Blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating. At a glance, you'd imagine they'd be fairly difficult to screw up. You've got a jump button, a suction / fire button, a time control button and an analog stick to control movement. Plus, there had already been a long, established line of three-dimensional platformers on the market in the years before the title's release, paving the way to an ideal control experience. Super Mario 64 had its issues, sure, but nothing like this, and it was the trailblazer for the entire genre's jump to the world of 3D. It's like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anyway.I can't even say I'm impressed by the graphics showcased throughout The Time Sweeper, either. With the exception of the lead character himsef, these are some incredibly cheesy, preschoolish character designs - they feel unfinished and hurried, less purposeful than you'd imagine (especially in contrast with Blinx himself). Particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels, trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury. Here's a finely detailed main character, with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again, and he's pitted against a set of monsters that could've sprung to life directly out of the pages of a four-year-old's sketchbook.Despite featuring a spoken dialog track, there's no English voice acting. I couldn't pinpoint the language, but my wife seems to think it's either French or some close variation of it. It certainly didn't sound Japanese. While this does add a touch of personality to the title, and it's not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love, it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television. Everyone's vocal personalities are so black-and-white, too, that I feel like a great chance to establish some much-needed individuality amongst the cast was lost once again here. The bad guys all have the same deep, gravelly, transparently evil tone, while the good guys are all bright, cheery, squeaky and high-pitched like the monkeys in Super Monkey Ball. It's like a parody of the games that had come before, but I won't give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purpose.Overall, Blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package, strapped to the shell of a far-below-average third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public. At the time of its release, it was still in need of a lot of polishing, some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a re-evaluation of just how far some of these concepts and half-hearted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality. On top of that, I really don't know which audience they were targeting with it. The game is ridiculously difficult, which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there, but so bright, kid-friendly and annoyingly cutesy that I can't imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day. The number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with Blinx, reaching near-Marvel vs. Capcom 2 levels with its unashamed, excruciatingly cheap hits, especially in later levels. I have no idea how I acquired the willpower to finish level eight.The game is adequately lengthy, and offers some replay value, with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches, promotional materials and the like. Once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those super-tough later levels, though, you'll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place. Unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps (I shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process) and enjoy self-mutilation, I'd recommend you stay far away.
As the opening cutscene introduces you to Blinx the cat, the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures, I found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story. The idea is that a secret, off-world clan of humanoid cat creatures, armed with souped up vacuum cleaners, are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map. It seems that time, when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats, takes the form of one of five different brightly-colored shapes. If these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things, they turn into monsters. I could go on, because the game certainly doesn't stop there, but I think you get the point.I like to think that there's a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super-detailed realism. Generally, a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game, because they're almost exclusively set in a photorealistic, lifelike location. Cartoons, on the other hand, generally don't worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time. How much fun would the Wile E. Coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate, it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics? Blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that's overly detail-centric in an environment that's right out of a kid's show. The result is a tale that comes off as way, WAY out of left field and almost completely abstract. It focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer's imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way.Beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world, how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear, the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic. There's a princess, evil pigs have kidnapped her, and it's up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world. That's it, no side-stories, no reasoning, no subplots - just a straightforward rush from Point A to Point B. And here I thought the phrase "save the princess" was universally recognized as an ages-old cliche.Now, I don't want it to sound like I'm railing on this game just because it's got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor. It's also completely lacking in character development, general storytelling and ongoing inspiration. None of the characters in Blinx really establish themselves as individuals, including the lead character himself. You don't hate the pig on the spaceship because he's trying to destroy the world, you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money. I honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three, because she's never mentioned between the game's start and its finish. I mean, the very first Super Mario Brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight.I don't honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging. The first level and a half are set up in the standard "get to know you" format, with the simplest of enemies, the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools. Shortly thereafter, you're thrown to the wolves. For the most part, the level designs are very short, with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge. I noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts, whether it's retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk (har har) above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point. You'll almost always know what needs to be done, but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick. I just can't overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is. If there's a bottomless pit nearby, (and chances are very good that there is) Blinx will find a way to force himself into it, regardless of what you're hitting on the control pad. If there's an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button, he'll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room, rather than the imminent threat.That's not to say that the entirety of The Time Sweeper is totally without merit, because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table, but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings. The ability to control time, for instance, was at the time a really fresh, interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today, despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged. You can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge, pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time, knock the level into slow motion, etc. All the while, Blinx is moving around in real time. It's a great idea, but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized. Why can't I use two controls at the same time? Why don't more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers? Why doesn't the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause, speed up or rewind when I use my time powers? Why is their duration so brief, and why can't I hold more than a dozen uses at a time? I mean, this could've really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run-of-the-mill platformer.The controls, too, are an undeveloped, undertested nightmare. Blinx himself is often sluggish to respond, especially when implementing his time controls. He has difficulty making a precise turn, whether on midair or on solid ground. He stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item, which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks. He routinely moves in the direction of certain death, as though pulled by a magnetic field, whether you've instructed him to do so or not. He'll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump, particularly when attempting a difficult, precise leap across a gaping chasm.I think it's these controls that most make Blinx so mind-squashingly aggravating. At a glance, you'd imagine they'd be fairly difficult to screw up. You've got a jump button, a suction / fire button, a time control button and an analog stick to control movement.

Having never played a MMORPG before Asheron's Call, I was floored by the immensity of the world and the depth of things to do. I subscribed to the game in early 2000, and other than a few months away from time to time, finally official unsubscribed at the release of AC's 2nd expansion pack, Throne of Destiny, this past month.I spent 5 years of my life spent playing Asheron's Call, investing 5-10 hours a week. I have tried many RPGs since, but nothing has hooked me like AC did.Unfortunately, my experience with AC was dysfunctional at best. The first year was amazing. I met many friends, and had a blast exploring. After 2 months I realized that my level 13 swordsman (without any magic) could barely hold his own against even the weakest of mobs, so I re-rolled. I created a spearman on a whim, and went to the packed Mossie Fort to level. It was there that I met Corrozus, my soon to be good friend and patron. Every night for a year we played together...laughed together, struggled together and leveled together. Everything that Dereth had to offer was explored by our ever-increasing alliance.I was a level 31 plinking away at Granite Golems in the Dires with my spearman the day that Turbine introduced the first wave of mobs that became the first chain on a link that lead to the ultimate death of the game. They were acid wielding, shield carrying skeletons, and my character couldn't touch them. In fact the mobs were so difficult that I heard rumors that players were now re-rolling en masse to create characters with Life Magic.As anyone who has played AC knows, Life Magic was broken from the start, and it took a while for the player base to learn this, but once we did, the game became a mere shell. Soon, uber characters abounded, and friends we once played with daily went off to level up their new uber toons. It seemed almost overnight everyone was level 50 killing Olthoi and Lugies in XP leveling dungeons while friendships and allegiance began to crumble.It was at this point that the original devs left, and the new team not only continued to allow life magic to remain unbalanced, but they built virtually all content around it. It was at this time that I began to dislike the game I once loved. I had few friends that weren't uber-focused. Allegiances became quest oriented as opposed to exploration oriented. And the devs catered to the elite players and ignored the average game player.Housing came and went, and I quit and re-subscribed several times. My playing time decreased severely to the point were I might log on once a week to seem no one from our allegiance on.Asheron's Call, it could be said, died a premature death because it listened to the 1% gamers who lived online. AC kept feeding the game XP and loot to keep them happy, and soon even a newbie couldn't step a few clicks outside of town without running into a level 79 mob.The Throne of Destiny expansion pack is more of the same. The game is all but dead, and simply exists to pull in funds to support Turbine's up and coming releases, D&D; Online, and Middle Earth. I won't be trying either. Just like a bad relationship, my time with Turbine is over and I want my 5 years back.

I'm writing this review after reaching the last board so I think I canhighlight the action of this inhouse made Microsoft game.  Thevisuals on the spells is the only thing keeping me from utterboredom.First thing to get used to is how small the characters are.  To get anidea of this look at your thumb, okay that's the size of your maincharacter as you navigate through outdoor wilderness fightingcreatures half your size.A zoom feature only works when you are not in combat, and that'swhen you realize that the humans in this world are nothing morethan escapes from some child's Fisher Price Play set.  Roundedcomical cartoon bulbous little hobbit folk.  Saying things like &quot;mommyI'm hungry&quot; indicating to me that this game is meant for 13 and under.The story and the plot are themes that have been done overtime and time again.  It's LOTR meets Willow and a dash of Gedof Earth Sea.  The combat is a sort of Diablo-Robotron run aroundthen dodge while throwing spells wildly.  No real strategy just aninfinite army of color coded repetitive creatures bum rushing you.With the lack of adventure titles for the Xbox right now this one mighthold you over till something better comes along (New Legends).  Sofar only Halo and Obi Wan have been the real enjoyable ones, thekind of games where a whole day of playing seems like only anhour.  Max Payne and Batman were a solid notch down, mostlybecause they were straight ports from other systems and offerednothing more except jazzed up graphics.

Okay. This was just a nightmare of a gaming experience. Just, unbeliavably terrible. Just downright horrible. To be completely honest, this wouldn't be a bad game for ten years ago. Or maybe for 2001 or 2002, as a late N64 or PS1 title. But considering this game is pretty recent,it's downright inexcusable. So why is this game so bad. Well, to sum it up, it's EXTREMELY hard, to the point of frustrating. Not to mention randomly spawning enemies. That's right. Randomly Spawning Enemies, like the kind you'd find in a Nintendo Mega Man game where as soon as you take your camera view off the screen, more enemies show up. And what reward do you get for killing off all the enemies in the vincinity? Why, even MORE enemies! "A hit squad has been dispatched to take you out." Add this on top of a game that has really no direction, no storyline, or even point to it, and there's not even any reason to play it. It ain't fun, by any definition of the word.Basically, you're a genetically made SuperSoldier who is created by "The Agency," all of the nation's law enforcement combined into one agency, and you're told by some annoying old disembodied Commander voice -who also serves as the game's narrator and the only actual "character" in the entire game- to wipe out three criminal empires. And off you go shooting, to kill literally hundreds of thousands of enemies by the time you finish the game, if you can even bare it that long. ALL you do in this game is basically kill bad guys and jump from rooftops, and while the latter may sound fun in a Spider-Man sort of way, it really isn't. At least Spider-Man has webbing to control where he wants to go. You know, flying would be a whole lot simplier. And easier. Oh yeah. The game also has some very poorly conceived races. Either a rooftop race, which are usually extremely hard to beat in time, or some insanely stupid driving race, which if trying to drive isn't hard enough for you, trying to complete a Time Trials race in the wrong lane will surely push you over the edge.When you start, all of your skills - Agility for leaping, Driving for absolutely nothing, Explosives for bombing, Strength mostly just for health, and Firearms for shooting- are all poor and barely usable. And after you've leveled up all of them as you go along in the game, well... they're still extremely poor. The only thing that increases is the leaping ability, in which you can go from 10 to 30 feet in leaping height. The sprinting speed sure don't increase like they say it does, that's for sure.Driving, is more or less, utterly pointless in this game. 95% of the time, you'll never be in a car! Which is good for two reasons because, for one, Driving controls are really really retarded. Both in setup and manuevering. That's how bad it is. Bad in the "it's almost impossible to not run into civilians" sort of way, even when your driving skill is near maxed out. Why they would even bother with a Driving skill, when the only time you'll ever even drive is to either do the stupid races, or mainly, to travel really far distances on the islands, is beyond me. But the other reason you won't be in a car much, is not to hear the insansely bad soundtrack for the game. According to the in-game "Jukebox," there are over 100 songs in this game, and all of them are really bad, third party techno tracks. Like the soundtrack came out of the skeeziest clubs in Europe. The game IS partially European, at least, which is why things are referred to in the game as a "centre" or a "lift." It's odd considering that the game takes place in the near-future West Coast America and that other things like measurements (pounds, height in feet and inches, miles per hour) are North American standard, and not Metric. Anyway, the soundtrack is really European, really Techno, and really, really bad. Maybe they figured Techno music is "futuristic?" It doesn't matter anyway, because they could've saved some money by not getting all of these crap songs (which you can't cut off, by the way) for the car that you'll rarely be using, anyway. At least it's nice that the car tells you how many miles per hour you're driving, though, as you accidently plow into an idiot civilian.Strength is another almost utterly useless attribute. It's only effectiveness is raising your health. But to level it up, you'll have to beat down on enemies using melee attacks, which is even more rarely used than a vehicle. 99.9% of the game is shooting, and you can only really raise your strength (health) by whacking an enemy with a gun, or kicking them, which does very little damage to them, anyway. You see, some of your skills are raised per usage. Meaning, the more you shoot, the more you blow stuff up, and the more you win races, the higher your stats will go, with 400 points being the maximum effectiveness level (even though the bar will continue to go up to 500.) But you'll almost never kick or hit an enemy, so raising this stat is pretty annoying.The other way you raise stats is by collecting a bunch of stupid orbs. Literally hundreds of orbs, scattered across literally every rooftop in the game, is how you increase your Agility. You don't have to collect all 500 of them to max out your Agility though, because of the rooftop races (although you really won't win those much) and the blue, "Hidden orbs" which increase a little of every stat. In fact, those were the only way I was able to get Driving and Strength skills up. The driving is bad, no matter what, though, and the Strength, although lets you lift and carry objects weighing tons, is only useful for health. I had about 300/500 Agility orbs and 100/300 Hidden orbs, by the time I finished the game, and only Driving was lower than Level 2 (300 to 399 points).The shooting in this game, though, is severely flawed. And not because of the weak Firearms skills and weak firearms in the game. But by the Auto-Aim targeting being severely broken. I swear, this auto-aiming NEVER EVER EVER works the way you want it to. It sems to target only the most furthest enemies, or moving non-enemies first, and ONLY focuses on the guy right in your face when there's absolutely nothing left to kill. While the game does give you manual shooting as well, it's pretty hard to kill anything that's not close up to you with it. But the broken aiming and an invisible enemy grenade that you'll never even see until you're already dead are the two biggest things that'll kill you the most with this game. And unless you really get into this crapfest of a game, you will die hundreds upon hundreds of times. I only had it on normal difficulity, and I died like 30 times within any given hour.All the guns are pretty weak, and when I found it, about late into the first gang and location, I wound up using the Harrington HMG 90 rifle throughout the remainder of the game. You only get two weapons to hold at a time throughout the entire game, by the way. The problem with all of the serious firearms is that they're power is compensated by an extremely low clip or insanely slow reload times, with the Harrington being the slowest. I counted the reload time of this thing. Six seconds. Now picture that. In the heat of warfare, having to spend SIX whole seconds just to reload the low clip on this stupid gun! Count to six and that's how much time you're waiting inbetween fire. In six seconds, you could lose all your armor and health and straight die while waiting for this thing to reload. And yes, being you only have two guns and some grenades throughout this whole game, I tried the Call of Duty style "switch to your other gun as you run out of ammo instead of reloading" tactic, only for that to not work as the stupid generic character you're using automatically reloads the gun when you run low or run out, so in order for the Call of Duty trick to work, I'd have to watch and make sure I don't go below ten bullets left and THEN, switch to the other gun in order for it to work, as the character's auto-reloading is completely and totally un-interruptable. SO annoying! WHY should a player have to endure crap like this? Throughout the whole game, I either used the Harrington despite it's insanely slow reload and some kind of rocket or grenade launcher, as anything else would be ineffective, have too small of a clip, hold too little of maximum ammo, or simply be just too weak. Sounds fun, doesn't it?The "characters" in this game aren't even characters. There's you, the generic, namelss "agent." (Maybe "Agent" is your actual name. I don't know.) There's the disembodied commander narrator/boss guy, who'll remark such sayings as, "Go like the wind, agent!" and "Simply pathetic." when you die. Having the game insult you every time you die, and dying because of some stupid glitch or flaw, is enough to make you want to break the game disc into tiny, little pieces. The "bad guys" are perhaps the most generic looking criminal bosses ever. It's like they looked in an LA phone book to get names for the Spanish lieutenants. There are three "gangs" that rule the city, but they're more like criminal empires because street gangs don't have that many soldiers and they don't actually run entire sectors of a city and it's inhabitants. They are  "Los Muertos" or "The Dead" (pretty clever, eh?), The Volk, and Shai Gen. Or... "Generic Spanish gang," "Generic Russian gang," and "Generic Chinese Corporation gang."The key members of the gang, like I said, are about as generic-looking as generic can get and when you actually find out where they're located and kill the hundreds of bad guys guarding them before you realize that they keep randomally spawning and that you should ignore them and just run towards the main gang lieutenant and kill them, you'll be rewarded with nothing, in the guise of a slightly higher ratio for success. You see, the game developers thought that it'd be clever to make fighting the main gang leader virtually impossible and that you would have more "fun" by taking out key lieutenants, who each enhance the criminal empire, be it by firearms, number of soldiers available, vehicles, etc., so that it becomes slightly easier to take out the main gang leader. But even WHEN you kill everyone else and save him for last, it's STILL virtually impossible, between the miles long approach to their headquarters, the endless spawning soldiers, and the enemy's eight life bars. Like most strongholds in the game, you're best to just run past everyone, trying to survive, and just go all out on the major gang leader before all the minions kill you. Screw "weaking their health" or "minimizing their recruits" with killing the lieutenants, because they won't do much help for you, regardless. But then, I guess, the game would be too short. In this case though, that'd be a good thing.I should also bring up that the map is even messed up. Yes, that's right! Even the MAP is a pain in the donkey. Not only is the map horribly out-of-scale with everything else, and not only does the map not provide you with any GPS or waypoint marking, but you CAN'T EVEN ZOOM IT IN! The map on the menu screen is just a tiny little map on the menu screen. You can't zoom it in to see closer, or anything. And the arrow representing you on the map takes up an entire city block in reality, meaning things that you may think are close by may be two blocks away from you! How often is it that you can say that the map in a video game is one of it's many, many flaws? Okay, so you can't zoom in, use a GPS, or even accurately know where you're at. Surely, the HUD "radar" map must be better, right? Nope. The biggest problem is, unlike ANY other game that uses an on-screen map, there's no "N" for "North." Just four arrows, any one of them could possibly be north. There's a reason why they don't put the "S"outh, "E"ast, and "W"est on these, and this is why. YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING! I can't tell you how many times I had to pause the game just to figure out which way was North. I often had to look one direction, pause to see the full map to see where I'm facing on it, and then, turn again until I got to facing North or where ever it is I had to go. How could they not have even gotten this right? It also would've been helpful if, being you spend most the game on the roof, to know which enemies were eye-to-eye level with me, above me, or below me. Usually, they make all things above you an arrow facing up on these game maps, and all things below facing down. But, oh no, not in this game! I died so many times because I couldn't tell if any enemy gang were shooting from above, from below, or from so far away, they wouldn't even show up in the compass map screen. Every single enemy is just a dot. Even if they're above me or below me. It's things like this that make you appreciate the little things in any given Grand Theft Auto title, where you don't have to try to figure out where North is, and that the arrows or triangles let you know right away which altitude an enemy is at. But not in this game! In fact, I've seen an effective map system in about EVERY Xbox 360 game that uses one, EXCEPT this game! Oh, and you can't even zoom the map in. Ins't that just something else?When you die, you have to restart from a "supply station," most of which are few are isolated between locations, and all of them have to be found and unlocked. Oh, and they're ALL on roofs, meaning you have to spend ten minutes climbing up top to them, and you could die just trying to get down from them! An elevator that you can use once you get up to the top the first time would've been nice. I mean, they actually HAVE them in the game and all, so it's not like they would've had to make one from scratch or anything. Any good gun you collect from an enemy HAS to be taken to this supply center/save point in order for you to keep it, or else, you'll lose everything you collected once you die. Sometimes, because of the random enemy pop ups, you'll, ironically, die trying to get back to your save point in order to save the guns you just got in case you die. You could be at any given rooftop, look one way, then look back and have a hoarde of random enemies pop up at you. Sometimes, you can even see them materialize in front of you. Sometimes, you'll restart at a save point and by chance, there'll be a ton of enemies right in front of your face as you just come back from the dead. I don't know. Maybe killing so many enemies as if they were an ant colony and jumping from rooftops sounds fun, but it's really not. Neither is dying a thousand times due to a broken aiming system or enemy grenade. You can still die by gravity, by the way, so with each roof, you still have to be very careful.The only good thing I can say about the game is that there's no glitches. Oh, wait. There are! Like, constantly getting stuck in a wall, or a rampway, or even the ground! Stuck as in, "this solid object isn't all that solid" stuck. And the random enemies. That counts, too. It's bad enough that once you kill every enemy in the near area, the game will have a "hit squad" of about ten cars come up and bring MORE enemies to you, but to have the ones you JUST KILLED re-materialize right in front of you is just insulting. Like, why even bother to kill them if it just makes more come to kill you, and the dead ones simply return back like it's nothing? Your character is a genetic clone and "The Agency" can make an endless supply of you in case you die. What's their excuse, though?Overall, this kind of pointless 3D "shoot and jump" kind of simplistic game wouldn't have been so bad on the N64, the original Playstation, or even as an early Gamecube title. I mean, the comic-book like art style isn't anything impressive or new or advanced. 1999 to 2002, this game might've been acceptable. An "average" game, at best. But this kind of simple, pointless, storyline-less, linear "shoot and kill just for the sake of it" game is far below what today's standards are in gaming. To imagine that this is an Xbox 360 title makes me think that this game probably spent so many years in development, that it's heavily outdated by today's standards. When you can't even tell which way is North on your compass map, you can't even zoom in your menu-guide map, and every single character is as generic as a white and black-text can of government corn, it really isn't a game ready to be released. At least not in any year past 2003, on any system greater than maybe Gamecube. This game is bad for simply being simple and outdated and just, really frustrating and lame and incomplete. I can't give this game a One because other than the "getting stuck" and "targeting," there really aren't any glitches or bugs in it. The game is somewhat playable.However, when a game makes you want to break something in it's incompleteness, or lose your mind and curse after getting killed by some stupid game flaw for the 219th time, something ain't right. I can't imagine anyone over twelve enjoying this game, not to insult anyone under thirteen, but only a simple minded person could enjoy a game this simple and generic. By the cover and art style, the game looks kind of cool. You sort of think "Gears Of War" combined with "Saint's Row." You get to use some high tech equipment to take down three ethnic gangs crippling the city. Sounds fun. And I'm sure, most people who bought this game bought it for the Halo 3 beta, but also because it looked or sounded like fun, right? However, I haven't played a game THIS bad since "Sonic Heroes." (and I would include every other Sonic game since then, had I actually played those also-poorly-rated titles) This is a game you simply want to break with your bare hands, or sell to any gaming store, even if you can only get $2.95 for it. Shoot, ANY amount of money the guy offers you at a game store, you'll take just to not have this horrible curse of a game in your life anymore. I can't say it's a Legend in the "Worst Games Of All Time" ranking, but it's definitely one of those games you'll get rid of, by any means possible, just to not have in your collection. It's like the DVD of "Gigli" or "I Know Who Killed Me" in your DVD collection that makes everything else you own, as well as yourself, look bad just by it's mere prescence, so you get rid of it, possibly erase all save files of it from your memory card or hard drive too, and pretend like it never happened. Yes, this game is a "pretend like it never happened" kind of game.AVOID this disaster at all costs! It's not fun, it's frustrating, and it's not even in-depth.
TL;DR:  Amazing singleplayer, OK multiplayer, which is a disgrace for a Halo game.It's been four years since the last events of Halo 3, when the Master Chief destroyed Delta Halo and was stranded on the other half of Forward Unto Dawn, drifting towards an unknown planet.  Halo 4 picks up right after Halo 3's Legendary Ending.To start, the game looks amazing.  It is clearly the best-looking console game to have ever been released.  Cortana has never looked better in a Halo game, and the facial structures and emotions from the humans in the game are simply a work of art.  Sometimes, I couldn't even tell if it's just a game of if they used real actors during the cutscenes.  The story of the campaign is easy (enough) to follow, but I wish they would've gone over what happened between Halo 3 and Halo 4.  More on that later in the spoiler section.The controls take a bit to get used to, since they tried to copy Call of Duty but with a slight Halo twist.  Banshee tricks are no longer mapped to the A button; you use LB to pull them off (WHY?!!!!), but other than that, if you didn't get so used to Halo: Reach's control scheme, you should be fine here.  Personally, I wish they would stop changing the controls so much and stick to what worked in Halo 2.  The gameplay itself, when it comes to the campaign, is your typical Halo experience we have all loved since 2001 when the original Halo launched with the original Xbox 360.  You're running through levels, shooting old and new enemies, uncovering the story, and reaching the end of a short campaign.  It took me five hours to be the campaign on Normal, but double that on Legendary.  I personally think the writing and the voice acting was well-done for everyone except Master Chief.  Some of his lines are unbelievable, and the painfully wrong tone is used sometimes.  However, it's still the campaign we expected from a Halo game.  But is the multiplayer the same we've loved since Halo 2?  No.  Unfortunately, no where near it.To start off, Halo 4's multiplayer has gone through a bit of a change since it first came out.  They greatly reduced the auto-aim that was present when the game first came out (nothing wrong with that), and have added a few new modes.  They also recently added in SWAT and FFA Throwback.  FFA Throwback is basically what the original FFA mode in the game should've been, ripped straight from Halo 2.  FFA KoTH and Oddball are FINALLY available to play.  For some odd reason, though, they removed Team Snipers. But if you bought Halo 4 hoping to have as much fun online as you did in Halo 3 or Halo 2, you will be more disappointed than I am.  I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I am with the multiplayer.For one, they introduced a CoD-style loadout menu.  Now you can pick your primary, secondary, grenade, armor ability, and two perks from the Infinity menu.  First of all, when was the last time Halo had perks?  I didn't play Reach so I can't speak for that game, but as far as I'm concerned, NO Halo game has ever used perks, period.  Why are they in Halo 4?  If I wanted to play Call of Duty, I would've waited for Black Ops 2 instead of picking this up a day after release.  I don't mind being able to choose what weapon I want to use, I'm actually glad they FINALLY let me use the DMR over the Assault Rifle instead of having to hunt for it on the map, but perks?  On top of that, gone is the hectic fast-paced action from Halo 2 and 3.  For example, I like to use the armor ability Promethean Vision because it lets me see enemies through walls.  And I have yet to play a game where someone wasn't crouched behind a corner waiting for someone to pass them, or behind a box, or underneath the enemy base waiting for someone to walk down.  Camping has always been in Halo; those that loved the sniper know what I'm talking about.  But to see it in literally EVERY single Halo 4 game I play online is horrific.  Gone are the arena-style FPS days of Halo when you got destroyed because people had a better shot and reaction time than you.  Now, all you need to do is pick Cloak, find a corner, and sit and wait for someone to walk by so you can either shotgun them from behind or assassinate them.  Unfortunately, Team Slayer Pro, a game mode that eliminates the motion sensor, armor abilities, and perks, does nothing to fix this issue.  If anything, it's worse, because people are now more likely to hide in a corner knowing that no one but their teammates will know they're there.  Oh, remember seeing an X where your teammate died in Halo 2?  Those are gone in Halo 4.  So now you have no idea where your teammate died.  His clan tag just disappears and comes back when he respawns.Another thing wrong with the multiplayer is the matchmaking.....I'm sorry, I meant the lack of matchmaking.  There is nothing that determines the players you're matched with.  For example, Halo 3 allowed you to choose between the quickest process or to only search for games with a good connection.  Those are completely gone from Halo 4.  I once played a game with a person from Guam.  Guam, for those that don't know, is a little island controlled by the United States that is located above Indonesia.  Can anyone explain to me how in the world someone that's thousands of miles away from the closest coastline of the United States managed to connect to someone living in the Midwest?  I stopped playing Uncharted online for the very same issue.  Too many times did I get paired with people that weren't even within my borders (Egypt, Portugal, Spain, UK, Brazil, etc).  There's nothing wrong with playing with foreigners themselves, it's just that the server I have to connect to in order to play with a foreigner is so far away, my ping is going to be ridiculously high, which means I'll experience a high amount of lag.  The only game I can think of that gave me little-to-no lag while playing with Europeans is Battlefield 3, which has dedicated servers.  Halo 4 does NOT have dedicated servers.  Another problem that comes with the lack of proper matchmaking is the mismatch of player levels.  It's never a good idea to pit a level 56, 65, 47, and 70 against a group filled with those still in the 10's and 20's, and I shouldn't have to tell you why.  Because of the absence of dedicated servers, there are times where the game will change hosts.  This is nothing new in a Halo game....except for the fact that someone may have killed you by the time your screen turns normal.  I've had that happen to me twice.My biggest complaint with the multiplayer, besides it being too much like Call of Duty and not enough like Halo, is Spartan Ops.  Spartan Ops is the biggest P.O.S. I have ever played since Uncharted 3's multiplayer.  NOTHING is good about Spartan Ops.  The entire thing feels rushed.  The cutscenes are short and make me miss dramatic pauses I originally thought were over-done in a lot of games and movies.  The lack of dramatic pauses makes me feel like "OK, what's going on h....oh...on to a new scene.  OK what's going o.......onto ANOTHER new scene".  I don't have time to take in and digest what I just saw/heard two seconds ago.  On top of that, the cutscenes are literally crap.  This person talks, this person responds, this person goes somewhere else, says "this is wrong" (Really, Sherlock?!), some random end scene, end cutscene.  I can go to YouTube if I wanted to laugh at short videos all day.  To make matters worse, the actual gameplay is more boring and repetitive than Firefight from the previous Halo.  At least Firefight was challenging and time consuming (even though those types of modes I have never liked).  Spartan Ops is literally, "kill these enemies, then kill some more, now move here, kill some more, hit some random switch, VEHICLES! :D, kill the last few enemies before the dropship arrives, end of episode".  An entire episode of Spartan Ops (five per chapter) takes ten minutes at the most, and that's on Heroic while playing with a group of randoms.  You just sit there, kill kill kill, boring dialogue, vehicles, end game, and you're then sitting there wondering "Why in God's name did I just waste 10 minutes of my life?"  The fact that these keep coming out every week only hurts Spartan Ops; that only adds to the repetitive feel of the mode.  The part that had me crying from laughing so hard is there are rumors (as of me writing this review and to my knowledge) that 343 Industries plan on charging for the second season of Spartan Ops.  YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!!  That's a bigger rip-off than paying for cheat-codes, like Capcom has tried to do many times before.  Personally, Halo 4 would've been a better game if they stopped wasting resources on the abomination that is Spartan Ops and actually spent them improving the multiplayer.**WARNING!!!  WARNING!!!  SPOILERS BELOW THIS POINT!!**As much as I liked Halo 4's campaign, like I said before, I wished they had explained more in the game.  For one, I had no bleeping clue who the Didact was until halfway through the game when the Librarian (again, don't know who she was, either, or why she was important) explained a bit of the history pre-Halo 1.  It would've been wonderful if the game was more friendly to newcomers/people who haven't been following the story/people who didn't read every book and watched every video made about the story.  I don't like having to search through hundreds of material to find out information on some of the events going on in Halo 4.  Granted the Librarian did do a fairly-good job catching me up, I STILL want to know, what happened to the Brutes?  They're just gone.  What happened to the truce between the Elites and UNSC?  Even Master Chief says this at the beginning of the game, "I thought we had a truce with the Covenant".  Now they're back at their old tactics, looking for random artifacts on some random planet for religious reasons, and making sure those filthy humans don't taint holy land.  Another thing I wish was more explained was what happened to the Arbiter after Halo 3.  A side-story on Halo: Waypoint explains he took the remaining Elites from the rebellion back to their home world.  OK, so why are they fighting alongside the rest of the Covenant?  They also barely talk about the Flood in Halo 4, and our favorite parasite is also absent from the game.  You blow up Delta Halo in Halo 3 and all of a sudden, no more Flood?  Maybe an explanation for some of my questions were explained in side-material, but again, I would've appreciated it if Halo 4 explained some loose ends, even briefly.Another problem I had with the campaign, besides it being short and a bit ridiculous on Legendary (headshots should kill shieldless enemies, period), why does Master Chief have such bad voice acting?  When Cortana informs him that she's not going back to Infinity with him, he stumbles with his words, then changes his tone completely when he says "We go together".  He went from complete disbelief to sounding like he was barking an order to a Marine.  It's so painfully obvious that it doesn't match, that ONE bit of the campaign is something I'll remember for a while.  I'm actually a bit neutral towards them showing his face for the Legendary ending.  His eyes were blacked out, but you got a pretty good idea of his facial features.  Nothing too major, of course.** END OF SPOILERS!!!**Overall, I miss Bungie.  I do like the campaign 343 created, and the graphics are amazing, but considering the multiplayer is only OK at best, it's a huge disgrace to the Halo franchise.  Halo's multiplayer has never been "OK".  Let's not forget it was the console king until Call of Duty 4 was released.  Unfortunately, 343's methods of handling the issues is quite poor, and makes me miss the way Bungie interacted with its fans.
I really went back and forth on this game, and had a lot of trouble deciding whether this game deserved three or four stars. As I thought about it more, I felt that even though I had a lot of fun playing it, this is just not a four star game. Allow me to elaborate...A common joke is that the first game in this series would have completely tanked if the Halo 3 beta code had not been shipped out in this game (and maybe they are right). I just thought the game looked like a lot of fun, so I bought it, Halo 3 aside. The original was not heavy on plot, and, like this second game, a lot of the "missions" feel grinding and repetitive. However, the first game made that grind a lot easier to bear in a number of small ways, all of which have been completely left out of this incarnation. I'm getting a little tired of developers 'fixing' sequels until they're broken.>>Plot:&lt;&lt;So let's talk about the plot, although this will be a short topic. Crackdown 2 has even less plot than the first one, which is hard to do. Now, my entire review won't just be a comparison of the second to the first, but I think for people who didn't play the first game, it is necessary to make a comparison to the first games' plot. So...in the first Crackdown, your goal is to fully eliminate three gangs that have taken over Pacific City. Reclaim it, area by area, one step at a time. You start with rank and file gangsters, and work your way up the gang hierarchy until you finally are able to go after the gang leader in their stronghold. There were personal dossiers on all the important players within that gang, how this effected that, how it would improve your chances of success if you took out every single one of the under-bosses before going after the heavy hitters.Incidentally, this tiny feature was something I REALLY liked in the original. For those who didn't play it, every time you went after an important gang member, your "Chances of Success" would be displayed. So if you were going after an under-boss and you had already taken out the four lieutenants working under him, your odds of success would be displayed accordingly, a much higher percentage than if you had only taken out one -- or none! So occasionally if you accidentally stumbled into the stronghold of a more senior leader and you saw "Chance of Success: 12.2%," I can't speak for anyone else, but I personally thought 'Sweet, this should be a real challenge then!' Of course if I kept dying, I would just give it up for a while. It was a tiny thing, but it added a bit of tension that is needed when you're playing a character with superhuman abilities.Now as I stated before, this second game has even less plot than the barely plot of the first one. But let's face it, Crackdown is not really meant to be a story-based game. The fun comes from being able to leap fifty feet from one rooftop to the next, pick up a streetlight pole and bash your enemies, chain together explosions to cause some massive destruction, kick enemies off of rooftops, shoot out a tire on a fast moving car and watch as it slides -- and then flips over...it's an action game, completely. And like a good action movie, there doesn't have to be a whole lot of plot or character development to have fun. And so it is the case of this game. So why do I give a non-story-based game three stars if I am not taking the story into account? Let me explain...The story is that ten years have passed since the events of the first game, the original agency tower was bombed, a virus leaked out of one of the three gangs' labs, and infected parts of the population (cue 'Freaks'). To go along with this, a new gang has essentially taken over the city. Your objective, your one objective (seriously, in the game there is only one objective [with numerous sub-objectives leading up to it]) is to rid the city of the Freak infestation. You do this by powering up energy sources in groups of three that shoot some sort of magical beams of blue light, and where the three points meet, then underneath that is a Freak lair, where you have to go and defend a beacon that is dropped via helicopter until it powers up, at which point it eliminates all the Freaks in the area. You defend the area by murdering every Freak that attacks the beacon as it is charging. Couldn't the helicopter just let the beacon power up first, and THEN drop it down into the lair? I mean then there would be no need to show a beam of light shooting up out of the beacon to meet the points of light above it...Apparently the beams of light know to shoot straight down to power the beacon remotely...or something. I don't understand...but I don't think the writers and developers really did either. So whatever just go with it. Yeah just don't ask them any specific questions though, ok.There are no plot twists, no secrets are revealed, you just do this. You activate 27 energy things, and detonate 9 beacons across the entire city. Along with that, you can also reclaim 25 (?) tactical locations from the gang inhabiting the city (basically they become strongholds or safe havens after you reclaim them where you can switch your weapon, grenade, and vehicle load-out). Talk about a drag. The same thing 25 times. As soon as you start the battles, about thirty enemies immediately spawn all around you, some of which have grenade or homing rocket launchers. You better run or jump out of there and take cover fast, because otherwise you're going to get pounded and will not be able to return fire. It's a bit of overkill, but I suppose they couldn't make it too easy or it would just be boring. Either way it does end up getting boring. But I guess it could have been worse, there could have been like a hundred of these tactical locations though. ALTHOUGH, then there are Freak Breaches, places where your beacons have damaged the ground and Freaks are pouring out. Correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't the beacons sole purpose to eradicate the Freak presence in that area? So please tell me how Freaks are going to pouring out of the ground at or very near a beacon epicenter. Honestly, do they think we're stupid? Basically it is the exact same thing as taking back the tactical locations. Kill a lot of them until no more come out. Boooooooooring. And that is the whole game. I don't say that's basically the whole game, it is the entire game, plot-wise. Obviously there are still things like rooftop races and road races, and agility orbs to collect. But that is the extent of the plot. Also, the beacon detonations are the only thing driving the plot. The Tactical locations and the Breaches are secondary objectives, and are not necessary at all to complete the story, which is extremely short. What lengthens the game is the desire to upgrade your character's abilities, and this, like the first game, is the real fun.The ending of the game is another gripe. So...the game ends, I won't spoil anything. And it leaves it open for...downloadable content? Or a third installment ($$$). But the way they did it is dumb. Basically they end the game where you cannot continue playing after you complete the game. You can just go back and reload your last save game after you beat it. But far from making me look forward to a Crackdown 3, I really feel like it's just a cop-out. Plot is a rare commodity in these games, so why not continue the story? God knows it could have use a change of direction...but whatever, we'll see where the downloadable content takes us, if anywhere.>>Graphics:&lt;&lt;I have read a number of reviews already about Crackdown 2 having lame graphics...but I don't really understand this. The graphics look nearly identical to the original, which is intentional. I would have been upset if the game started to try to take itself seriously and NOT have used cell shading. The game has its own style, and it's one of the reasons I like this franchise overall, because it is original in that way. I know I might be in the minority here, but honestly, can't people stop whining about graphics? Those games you loved to play ten years ago? Horrible graphics, compared to where they are today. Honestly people need to get over having things look nice. Avatar looks amazing too, but I hated it because everything in it was so one-dimensional. So basically what I'm saying is that a game should be judged by what is under the hood, with one caveat: Obviously there are games that boast amazing visuals, or where it would actually be expected of the game, and where this is the case, it can be judged likewise. But Crackdown 2? If what you're looking for is epic visuals or gritty textures, then I'm afraid you have missed the point entirely about what Crackdown 2 is aiming for.>>Gameplay:&lt;&lt;I had a very love/hate relationship with the gameplay in Crackdown 2. It seems like they made it more complex and accomplished even less than the original. I have read numerous other reviews detailing how awful the targeting system is in this game...but for the most part, it's a relatively small annoyance (But don't get me wrong, there are parts when it will really frustrate you. When I went to lock on to one of the ten enemies all firing around me, why did I lock on to an agency (Those are your allies) cruiser way off in the distance? To add on to that, when you are battling a horde of 'Freaks,' (Zombie-like enemies that try to overwhelm you with sheer numbers), I think it would have been better, when you go to lock on to one of them specifically when there are fifty all rushing you, to have it lock on to the one that is the most dangerous to you. I don't know, it makes sense to me. Kinda pointless otherwise.I had a few issues with clipping and with seeing some npc's start to descend a flight of stairs and then fall straight through them (though I had no problems with that myself, so I don't really hold that against the game, it's just worth mentioning). I did, however, have some problems with on-again off-again grappling when I would try to jump to a ledge. In certain locations (few, but still irritating), I would jump to a ledge, hang there, then try jumping to another ledge, and if I missed, I would try to catch the ledge I had jumped from, but my character would not grab it. Then when I would try to jump to it again, he wouldn't grab it. When I came back at other times though, it was fine...so...I don't know, doesn't make sense to me.>>The Silver Lining:&lt;&lt;I should talk now about what the game does right, or, to rephrase, what the developers didn't change from the original. The agility orbs. There are 500 once again, and once again, they are fun to track down. Crackdown 2 also has implemented a twist on this, called Renegade Orbs. There orbs will streak away from you, dive, rise, turn sharply -- as you try to catch them. At first I thought it was irritating, but there is a sense of accomplishment when you do mange to catch one as it slows down to change direction. It just requires some patience and a little luck. They do the same thing with the driving skill. There are Renegade driving orbs as well. 30 of each kind.The weapons are pretty cool, though one frustration they didn't eliminate (go figure) from the first game is that you will have to equip and carry any new found weapons back to a tactical location so that you can use it in the future. It would be nice if you just unlocked them as you leveled up the weapons skill. But whatever, minor gripe. And it just occurred to me that they also did away with pistols in the game altogether, though obviously since I am just now noticing this (after playing through the entire game without noticing it), it isn't anything you will really miss. The weapons are essentially the same as the first game, but with different names. I would have liked to see an introduction of melee weapons though. Since you can pick up environment objects and swing them, it would have been cool to be offered a sword or a baseball bat or something actually designed to be used as a melee weapon (as opposed to picking up a car and smashing it repeatedly into enemies' faces!). Some vehicles also have weapons on them now. The Agency Buggy has a gatling gun, as do some Cell (gang) cars, as well as a rocket launcher variety. The Agency supercar also still has the 'Scoop' ability (You can drive under other vehicles and it scoops them out of your way without interrupting your driving).>>Conclusion:&lt;&lt;My final advice is not to expect too much. I think a number of people did, and then were let down. This game should be played for fun. The over-the-top-everything in this game has to be the ends in itself, and not the means to the end of the story, because there isn't much of one. I still think that this game is extremely fun and addicting, even taken with all of the flaws it has. This game can provide you with hours of fun if you don't try to force it to be any more than it is.
I was one of the many that pre-ordered halo 2 because I enjoyed the first one so much. About me and seven of my friends bought it at the midnight release and went to my buddies house where we played it all night and my friend and I beat the co-op storyline around 8 or 9 the next morning. There were some things I liked and hated about the game.Storyline: If you played the first one the storyline is lacking and really straightforward. You play the "hero", fight against aliens and save humanity/earth whatever. For the second one when they released video clips it made it sound as if the aliens found earth and are attacking it and you (master chief) were turning earth into a crazy urban war between humans and aliens. Its been a long time since I played the storyline, actually the night of its release was the last time, but you only end up fighting on earth for the first one or two levels (I use the term lightly as halo has no "real" levels). Then you end up going into one of the alien ships or something like that. You also get to play as one of the aliens, which I found to be rather fun but also a "played" story gimmick as this has happened in other games as well. The ending was very dissapointing as it just left you hanging and wanting more and hoping there was actually more to the story left. Bungie could have done a better job and made the story more developed and the game a bit longer.Graphics: I've read a lot of reviews saying that the graphics are awesome but I didn't see a great deal of difference between halo and halo 2. However, I also didn't play either game with HD cables on an HDTV. They used the same engine and just added what seemed to me a polishing effect to the "levels" and characters.Sound: I love the music to halo and I was happy to hear the music back in Halo 2. Also the human and alien voices are fun to hear. The multiplayer firefights and single player firefights are wonderfully done as it helps to make you feel like you're actually there in the game.Weapons: I was dissapointed in the weapon selection as there seemed to be no imagination to what they did with them. Humans have a sniper rifle so lets give aliens a sniper rifle. Humans have rocket launchers (the rocket launcher now targets and follows enemy vehicles-nice!) so aliens need a rocket launcher. The plasma rifle was given an unneeded change as it no longer froze your enemies in place to circle around them and hit them in the back, which made the rifle now another useless weapon in your arsenal. I enjoyed the sword in single player but in multiplayer was a very frustrating weapon to fight against. In single player the sword ran out of charge after so many hits but in multiplayer it lasted the whole game which was a very annoying thing. If you've ever played halo 2 multiplayer you know what I'm talking about. The pistol was toned way down but with few updates they gave it some power back but was nowhere near the "horror" like the first. Grenades were the most and saddest thing they changed in the game. I loved grenades in the first one and ended up using them more than anything in the game. So when I played halo 2 the first time I couldn't wait to throw my first grenade and when I did I literally freaked out. Master Chief "dropped" the grenade right in front of me and when the explosion happened I was still alive??? They turned Master Chief's powerful throwing into a "toss" or "drop" and the explosion of the grenade......well lets just say I might as well have been throwing waterballoons at the aliens with the damage that one of those did. The last thing they did was duel-wield which was a nice feature but the balance of duel-wield and other weapons was crap. The duel thing could've been left out and was a much over-hyped feature.Vehicles: Like I said with imagination- Bungie seemed to be lacking in that department. Humans have a tank and a warthog so lets give the covenant a tank and warthog. I know, I know the covenant tank was in the first one but could you drive it?? Nope. I liked the fact that vehicles now could be blown up and that you could kick people out of the vehicle and take it or if you were crazy like me you could jump in a warthog with an opposing team driving it, thats always fun. I do wish they would have given you the option to turn vehicle damage on or off. In multiplayer you would destroy the warthog and a few minutes later they would have a brand new one waiting for them, so that was annoying too. The last thing they changed that I didn't like was I couldn't run over people anymore, well you can but its a 1 in 6 shot that you'll actually do it.Physics Engine: I hate the physics in halo 2, one thing that made the original halo so fun was playing "warthog basketball" in blood gulch or blowing up a ghost over the middle of sidewinder and watching it fly.Multiplayer: Multiplayer is chaotic and can be fun but 70% of the time if you're not playing with a friend it is frustrating to hear people cussing you out, making really annoying background sounds etc. The addition of "team chat" only would've been really nice. Most of the upgrades they did to the multiplayer levels were nice and done really well, the name changes weren't really necessary though. I liked the setup for the xbl matching, I just wish that the players had more control over what levels, weapons, radar and such would go on during the game instead of the pre-made matches (that counted to your ranking) that you ended up playing over and over and over and over again. Also the hacking and modded xbox's that you would play sucked too, that was neither bungie's nor microsoft's fault, but did hinder the fun of the multiplayer experience.Vision change: For the longes time I couldn't figure out why halo 2 seemed visually different than halo 1. One day, it hit me, I was playing multiplayer and was running around getting p'wned as I usually did in halo 2 and I realized the levels were closer to me than in the first one. I realized the developers went for a tunnel vision view instead of the periphial expanded look as in the previous one. In halo when I walked around, I had a periphial view and the levels looked so much larger and massive. In halo 2, however, they give you a more narrow view and make everything seem closer for a more "unreal" look, by unreal I mean like the unreal series.Single player exploration: This is one of the things that made the original halo so awesome. My friends and I would spend countless hours in the single player mode going to areas we really weren't supposed to go and do things that were absolutely fun and crazy. You could actually get online and see things people would do and it made it all the more entertaining. In halo 2 they "controlled" the areas that you were not supposed to get to by putting skulls or I think in one level there was a huge ball or something. That made me lose the appeal to actually go and explore the level like I did in the first one. Now the developers want me to go find these "hidden" places that I wasn't supposed to......puh-lease!!So to sum it all up, the cons seemed to outweigh the pros for me as an avid Halo 1 fan. The lack of vehicle and weapon imagination, physics engine change, tunnel vision with the short and dissapointing ending storyline made the rush of halo 2's release makes Halo 2 an average to below average first person shooter experience. Halo 2's multiplayer is fun with friends and the added detail in the levels makes it more tactical and visual treat. If you're looking for a game that has a good story and imagination this is NOT the game for you but if you just wanna play a fun shooter with some friends its not to bad of a game.It only gets 2 stars from this dissapointed halo fan.....

First, to Mr. Scott Hoffmeyer (read down for his review)  The Mechs are based on actual Mechs in the FASA Board/Paper games... the "Timberwolf" is and always was the "Mad Cat" and the Atlas is suposed to have a cockpit that looks like a smirking skull :DAt any rate.. the graphics certainly are a step up from MW3, and look quite good, though the mechs do seem "smaller" than they did in MW3.  However, that seems to suit the generally 'scaled down' feel of the game as a whole.  A blast from a Gauss rifle might send your mech flailing, but it doesn't seem to pack the same punch as they did in MW3.  As has been said, the gameplay seems to be working away from its strategic roots into more of an "arcade" style.  This might be nice for some, but for longtime fans of Battletech and strategy in general, its a bit of a letdown.Multiplayer can be fun, but unfortunately, even with the new "customizing" interface, people still find ways to "hotrod" mechs, allowing them to deal crippling damage in just a few shots.  MP would be much more enjoyable if players were limited to preset "variants" of mechs, thus allowing you to still pick one to suit you, but disallowing people from loading up with the most destructive weaponry available.Decent game... the simplicity is a definite turnoff however, battles tend to be drawn-out slugfests rather than a test of piloting and well-aimed shots.

If you are a long time player of Mech games, then heres how to gauge MW4: If you loved MW3, you'll hate (or at least be very dissapointed with) MW4. If you hated MW3, than you'll love MW4. There are many intelligent improvements made in MW4, but ultimately, the look and feel of the game is painfully cartoonish and hard to take seriously. The actors portaying the storyline fall far short of the mark in conveying the intended drama of the story. Missions are fairly interesting, music is superb (composed by Duane Decker, who also did the soundtrack of the MW3 expansion 'Pirates Moon'), terrain detail is astounding, and the early lunar missions skyline is awe inspiring; But despite these pros and a few others, MW4 just doesn't deliver the impact it should. As far as this pilot is concerned, Mechwarrior 3 is king of the battlemech games, even though its not perfect either. If your thinking of MW4; save the cash and spend half of it on the MW3 that comes with Mechcommander Gold and Pirates Moon(...). But dont take my word for it, look at some pics from 3 and some from 4; Then choose your mech...to each his, or her, own.

This is an excellent &quot;product&quot; from a guy who admits he is just a &quot;casual&quot; gamer. He actually admits this in an interview somewhere and I think he's more competent than most designers and much  older. So there, you little whipper snappers.My main complaint with this  game has nothing to do with the game or developers except that they should  be more careful about who they allow to start fan sites. A certain very  popular site, perhaps the best site with the best forum gave me a very bad  experience. In one of my first posts a regular there refered to me as  stupid and silly and wondered in public if I was senile. All this because I  questioned the diplomatic system in AOK, which any competent reviewer will  recognize as being a joke.  When I complained to the moderators of this  site about this abusive behavior and a general abusive behavior towards  Americans, I was banned from the forum and my ISP contacted for the crime  of contacting these people through e mail.  And now on to more pertinent  information.I found the game easy to learn and fun to play. The  graphics were good but not great. Pretty soon I found myself relying on one  strategy. Wall out the invaders. Get to castle age as quick as I can and  build lots of town centers to expand and defend. Once you beat the initial  big invasion, the idiotic AI tends to just send invaders in little trickles  that never stop, but aren't that hard to deal with.It's fun to use  the various seige weapons, but I didn't really bother mastering the armor  and tremendous variety of knights and swordsmen. They all looked about the  same to me with the exception of the english longbowmen. You could play  this game for a very long time, but there are lots of very good games to  play.This is deep strategy, but not as deep as Railroad  Tycoon 2 and  Rogue Spear. It's also all tiny people and buildings. There's no zooming in  and out or rotating. The fans are kind of ummmm...well, you read what I  said above.I only played twice on the internet and the first guy  left as soon as I knocked down his whole wall with a massive seige attack.  The game then ended leaving me without the ability to even finish off what  he'd built. My second game I used the wrong culture and after a prolonged  build up I quicklly got slaughtered by the elite teutonic knights. My Woad  raiders didn't have the ability to build cannons I found out too late. So  there you have multiplay in a nutshell. If you are winning, people leave  and call you a hack. If you are losing, they love you and possibly think  you suck.There was no third, more experienced multiplay for me as I got  wrapped up in the incident up top and lost interest in the game.
