An enthralling experience, it feels like you're reading a good novel, but with interactive elements. The characters are very well-written, their dialog suits them perfectly. There are some spots where the action grinds to a halt, when you're clueless as what to do next, but then you have this "Eureka" moment (your mileage may vary :)Overall, a very recommendable game to the intellectual gamer with long attention spans
Kirby's avalanche is one of those spin-offs like mario paint or pokemon puzzle leauge. I bought this game because I had and "fc twin" which can play NES and SNES games (It's not offacial) and all I had for it were two NES games, super mario bros. and the legend of zelda. When I read on wikipedia it coulden't play kirby super star I was pretty disapointed so one day when I was looking for kirby SNES games I came across this. After reading reviews and watching videos on google video, It reminded me of tetris but with cute blobs. I wanted a SNES game. I wanted a kirby game. I wanted a tetris-style game. I wanted a game with cute blobs. And finnaly, I wanted a 4-dollar game (XD). So I bought it!Now for the gameplay. This is how you play: Different colored blobs will fall down in pairs; you must have four of the same color (or more) attached by having them fall to the ground or each other. When this happens, they will explode (not like a bomb, they'll just kinda go "poof") If they fill to the top, the game is over and you can retry the level you were on. The main way to win is to get chain reaction where a set of blobs explode, the different colored pair on top of it will fall down on to more blobs of its clolor, causing them to explode as well and on and on. When you do this, gray blobs will fall in your oppontens side of the screen (depending on how much chain reactions you cause) the only way to get rid of gray blobs is to explode blobs next to them. The ones the explosion was next to will dissapear. The controls are bassicly the same as tetris. .On the start menu, you have the choice of playing "competition", "1P VS. 2P "(Two player mode, player one versus player two)"Practice", and "options". Competition is where you have a chioce of choosing "learning stage" which is only 3 easy levels, "normal, which starts you off at the beginning, or hard, which is about three enemies later after normal. How it works is you start playing one computer, and keep on advancing. practice is self-explanatory but I'll tell you how it works anyway. You choose a diffuculty and play alone (actually  a two player can play if he or she wants to, but this is beside the point) when you get a game over, you can restart. Then there's versus. whoever has there blobs get to the top, thus losing, first, will lose. Then you can rematch or quit. finnaly, there's options. This most likley the coolest options screen iv'e seen. You can change the controls, listen to all of the music and sound effects in the game, etc.All in all, its a good game, just challening.

I bought this game thinking it would be just like the previous THQ/WWE's N64 titles. They sure fooled me tho. The game play is definitely different from the previous versions. Altho each wrestler now has less moves than before, I find that the faster and smoother moving actions allows for a little more excitement with limited moves. Dont get me wrong here, the graphics on this game are sharp and killer and it's loads of fun to play. I just feel that THQ could have done far better than this effort. Perhaps this is almost like a trial run for them w/ wrestling games on the game cube...or perhaps they just bungled. They should have left some of the options and such from NO MERCY and WRESTLEMANIA 2000 in this game. Wrestlers have less moves, less outfit options, less taunts...there's no story lines when it comes time for the belt chasing...create a wrestler lacks a lot of different outfits, hair, faces, etc....there aren't as many moves for the wrestlers or created wrestlers. What also bothers me is that there are no interferences during matches. I rather liked that. Having a singles match and suddenly Triple H or someone comes out and tries to whip my ass. Another thing that bothers me is that wrestlers dont come out with managers or team mates. The last thing that annoys me about this game is that every little bump and hit from other wrestlers knocks you to the ground...sure it's pretty much realistic...but can be annoying; and why does the computer controlled wrestlers always gang up on me? Sure I've done a lot of bithching, but the game is still fun as all hell. It's fast, smooth...and the finisher moves were never more easier to perform. Looking at this game as if NO MERCY and WRESTLEMANIA 2000 never existed, it's killer...but we all know that those N64 titles were out there and I think that THQ should have just stuck with that style. Let's hope their next effort it a step up. This game is still fun, keeps me playing forever, and the graphics are detailed and sharp...exactly why I gave it a 4 and why I would recommend it regardless.

The old Fed might have changed its name, but nothing is new in WWE WrestleMania X8. While X8 is the first and only GameCube wrestling game to date, it amounts to a disappointing game that will have GameCube owners going to their PS2-owning friends' houses to play SmackDown. WrestleMania X8 is the first wrestling game since WWE took over WCW and got sued by wildlife conservationists, and sadly, that's about all that's new. THQ claimed that X8 would be "back to basics," but the biggest difference between the Xbox's WWF Raw and X8 seems to be the games' rosters. There's no real "season" mode, and what there is lacks the flair of even a Street Fighter game's pre-match flair. Grappling and striking still work in the simplistic, puddle-deep way of every game since the classic Yuke's N64 grapplers (many of Yuke's members came from Aki), and while wrestling fans who just want to be The Rock will be pleased with this, people looking for more control and strategy (&agrave; la Crave's UFC games) will be sorely disappointed. It's time for wrestling games to grow beyond the "Our superstars will sell this" era and add some actual depth to the wrestling. WrestleMania certainly looks great with accurate wrestler models and excellent arenas, but all that beauty is wasted on the slack animation system that lacks the fluidity and realism of motion-captured animations in other games. While X8 is good with scaling characters to their actual relative size (Big Show is much larger than Scotty Too Hotty), the animation system doesn't respect the larger characters, so you get people's arms disappearing inside others' bodies during holds and other mutant effects. Also, for some reason, the female wrestlers look awful. Why the male wrestlers look great and the females look like bipedal goats is a mystery. Yuke's has been making wrestling games for years, but for some reason the company can't seem to settle on a successful control scheme. While the moves are simple and easy to perform, other actions-like picking up tables, climbing the corner ropes, and escaping a steel cage-are unintuitive and annoying. You'll get friction burns trying to escape the cage as you have to jiggle the analog stick and bang the A button to make your character sloooooowlyyyy lifffft hiiis armmmm overrrr the caaage. On the other hand, your opponent only has to run toward the cage wall to knock you down. It's silly and annoying, and it easily deflates the fun of a cage match. Last but not least, X8's sound is purely awful. The wrestlers' entrance tunes sound like they're muted through a blanket over the speaker, and the in-match elevator muzak tears away the WWE attitude the game tries so hard to invoke. It's as if Yuke's thought it was still working with the sound-unfriendly N64. Wrestling fans deserve a great wrestling game, but unfortunately, this isn't it. It had promise, but in the end it's just another WWE game hurt by lack of attention to the game in favor of the license.

I must say, after 10 years that this game STILL holds up well, especially for the GameCube.  When it originally came out, I played a demo of it at Target and was amazed at the gameplay, wonderful animations and graphics of this game.  This great game has awesome gameplay in simulation and arcade mode, which the latter stands out in the game, where you can choose a team and three superstars in an outdoor beach court.  This game is the best in the Courtside series and would highly recommend this game for GameCube owners who are basketball fans. Also, I would recommend to those who are reminiscent of the rosters of this game - Shaq and Kobe on the Lakers, AI on the Sixers, Antoine Walker and Paul Pierce on the Celtics, J. Kidd and Kenyon Martin on NJ, Baron Davis on the Charlotte Hornets, etc.

Completing a Fire Emblem game is like taking care of a bonsai tree; painstaking but spiritually rewarding.  Anyone familiar with a Fire Emblem game knows two things about the series: it's an SRPG and when your characters die, they die permanently.  And so you must carefully cultivate your tree, your party, making sure none of the branches, characters, break, die horribly, prematurely.  By in large this isn't an especially difficult process as you can make use of the weapon triangle to keep your people going.Now the weapon triangle refers to the relationship each general weapon type has with one another.  Swords perform better against axes, axes are better against spears and spears are better against swords.  These differences and bonuses are reflected through apre -battle window that's tells you the probable outcome of the attack you're about to launch.  Magic in the game follows suit in a similar triangle though the more recent games on theGamecube and Wii have dropped one of the arcana which sadly clips that. Plot for these games has never been a highlight.  Instead, the gameplay itself is always the primary draw.  Even characterization tends to take a back seat to battle as you mature your character's relationships with conversations that may occur when you place specific characters next to one another in combat.  Of course there are several different kinds of units and each is allowed to wield only certain kinds of weapons.The first Fire Emblem I played was, in turn, the first to come out in the US.  Although, in truth, it was around the eighth or so in the series and the second on theGameboy Advance.  Well, I'll be biased here because it was my first, blush, but regardless many consider this entry rather highly as I do.  My primary joy when playing the Fire Emblem games would be the battle animations when you launch an attack.  Watching little 2D sprites tear into each other is very satisfying.  While I've only dabbled in the other games I've preferred the cast of this game the most.  They were all the most entertaining, specifically the lead heroes. Eliwood , Hector and Lynn, extra emphasis on Hector, are great noble characters and, from what I've seen in other games, rather typical of Fire Emblem heroes.  Even so, I care for them the most even if they are, as my love is for them, rather shallow.Now as an SRPG, the game runs just fine, nothing extra special but it functions well.  Against, as said before, the battle animations are the most visually appealing part of the game next to the portraits.  That would then be the first problem I had, the actual sprites during battle are hideous.  At least the sprites on the old NES had an excuse, SNES improved them but the GBAs are just horrible.  Now don't be confused.  The gorgeous attack animation sprites are completely different from those sprites that you move on the actual battlefield map.  Music falls just as short.  I don't recall any of the tunes from the game at all.I would suppose then that the only short comings are really only the few I've mentioned: no epic story, some lackluster sprites and music to boot.  Thegameplay is what makes up for all these problems.  Doesn't hurt that the core campaign is meaty, and that doesn't include the different difficulties and optional Hector story-arc which is an extra fifteen missions.  This game is a great handheld package for anRPGer and tactically minded fellow, if you can find a copy snatch it up immediately!

This is seriously one of the best games I've ever played. UbiSoft and Michel Ancel (who also created the first two Rayman games) should be commended for this startlingly fun and imaginative game.Graphically, the game is superb. The artistic design of the world is fabulous, and the water (of which there is a great deal) is beautifully rendered. The creatures that inhabit the world (and that you regularly photograph) are excellent designs: familiar enough to be believable creatures, but strange enough to be believably alien. The environments are also a feast for the eyes, and range from lichen-encrusted caverns to wide beaches to hideous industrial mazes. Character designs are also excellent, and feature an array of anthropomorphic animals -- including your sidekick Pey'j, who looks like a blend between a trucker and a giant pig.Character control is almost effortless, though some of Jade's special moves are difficult to induce. I've particularly had trouble getting her to backflip at times. However, except for the charging maneuver, none of the special moves are absolutely necessary for the game, and I never had any trouble with that one. You may get frustrated in some areas, but in my experience the fault has always been with myself or my approach, not with the game or controller.The real strength of this game, however, is the variety of play. Classic adventure-game problem solving is supplemented by stealth/infiltration, martial-arts combat, vehicle-based fights, and even kart-style racing. And that's just what you HAVE to do to finish the game -- if you desire, you can follow the game into a number of other directions. You can even choose to take none at all... there's a lot to be said for just sitting back and enjoying the scenery.Much is made of the plot, and it's certainly more substantial than some I've seen. Still, don't expect _War_and_Peace_. This is still in the realm of plots that are "very good for a video game", which is a bit of a disappointment, because a few more (or more believable) twists to the plot would have made this into a really interesting story. Nonetheless, the progression will be more than enough to keep you engrossed. The character interactions are also quite believable (some scenes between Jade and Pey'j are truly touching).Voice acting is solid, and the music is really lovely. I found myself wishing I could buy the soundtrack, just so I could hear the music which plays on the water in early sections of the game (and also in the final credits).The game's only real weakness is its length (I was able to play through in ~15h my first time, while seriously trying to go EVERYWHERE). However, the gaming experience itself is quite varied, and most puzzles admit of multiple solutions (there will only be a few occasions when you're absolutely locked into a single course of action). Add to this the gorgeous visuals and music, and this becomes a game you'll be able to replay without regret.To summarize--Gameplay: SuperbStory: Excellent (for a video game... >sigh&lt;)Visuals: SuperbAudio: SuperbReplayability: ModerateOverall: Superb (91%)At [this price], you'd be foolish not to buy it.

I've been playing adventure games since the original Crowther & Woods ADV.COM for CP/M, then later Infocom's Zork series (and others, including Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), and on and on until finally I got hooked on the Tomb Raider series on Macintosh.  In other words, I know whereof I speak when I say Wind Waker may be the best adventure-style game I've ever played.  In my humble opinion, the Legend of Zelda games rank as one of the great crown jewels of Japan, right up there with Nikons, Toyotas and Zen.  The game starts slowly, and builds and builds ... and builds ... and builds ... until, when the little guy finally defeats the Big Hands in the Tower of the Gods ... and you enter the strange, black and white eeriness in the Castle beneath the Sea ... and you realize you've only just BEGUN to play this game, when at THAT point you realize you've been spending so much time in front of your TV and your GameCube because THAT world is so immeasurably more fascinating than THIS world, it strikes you:  What Nintendo has done defines magic.  Shakespeare at his finest could do this for an evening; Nintendo does it for days, weeks, and even longer.  Ok, that's hyperventilating, so enuff said.  But still!  Unless you have a deficient attention span or a prehuman intolerance for puzzles and mystery, PLAY THIS GAME.  Allow me to add, parts of Wind Waker are not specifically aimed at kids.  The final showdown with the Big Poe was both hilarious and immensely satisfactory, philosophically speaking.  I found myself thinking of schizophrenia, Dante's Inferno and the Stapuft Marshmallow Man simultaneously.  Mostly droll, occasionally satirical, Wind Waker sometimes walks a fine and perceptive line between storytelling and proscenium-bending sarcasm.  Example:  Why does the Nintendo Gallery sculptor hate Link's pictograph of Lenzo and his lady friend?  Because Link (i.e, you, dear gamer) acquired it by stealth!

This is it, this is one of the most amazing pieces of software I have ever played. I am reviewing this game almost exactly 10 years after it's release and it is still amazing. The sense of speed in GX is one of the most zen like feelings I have ever had with anything in my life. It holds up and I'm still playing it. I don't know what elese to say about this game other than it is a masters work. Hiroyuki Sakamoto & Toshihiro Nagoshi should make the next games if Nintendo ever decides to bring this series back. But truth be told, if this was the last F-Zero to ever be made, I wouldn't be mad about it because you can't improve on perfection. I'm sure I'll still be playing this for another 10 years! Thank you so much Sega & Nintendo for making this game.

This game was problably meant for four year olds becuase my friends three year old can get past the first level. I have to admit it was fun though. My recimendation, don't buy it, it's not worth it.

The meat of this game is the 120 brainteasers contained, and sometimes hidden, within the Curious Village.There is an overall mystery surrounding a Golden Apple, as well as some additional mysteries happening in the village, but you will not be solving those mysteries directly.  In fact, the mysteries are so contrived they are not solvable by the game player.  Instead, the mystery solutions are revealed to you as you progress through the game.So what will you be doing? You'll be solving the brainteasers the residents of the Curious Village toss at you as you walk around investigating the mysteries.  The riddles range from very simple (10 points) to very hard (70 points).In the simplest riddles, you may only have to assemble a simple jigsaw puzzle.  In the most difficult puzzles, you will have to figure out how to place chess pieces on a chess board so that none of them cross each others' paths, yet all are able to capture any other piece placed on the chess board.This game is not for young children.  The content is family-friendly, but a great many of the riddles are unsolvable by anyone who's not at least in junior high or even high school.Although many of the puzzles are difficult, you will collect Hint Coins throughout the game.  They are hidden in many different places within the village, such as a garbage can or light pole.  Simply touching an object with the stylus will pop-up a hidden Hint Coin.  You then use these Hint Coins to buy up to 3 hints per riddle.  Note: The first hint is almost always entirely useless.  There are plenty of Hint Coins hidden in the game.  I ended the game with 85 unused Hint Coins.  I found 118 of the 120 puzzles and solved 115 of them.It's an enjoyable game, but remember, you'll be solving the riddles, not the mystery.  The mystery itself is nothing more than a backdrop and excuse to serve up riddle after riddle for the player's enjoyment, addiction, and - sometimes - frustration.
I got this game because I wanted to learn how to cook great food. I can describe this better as a digital and interactive cookbook. It lists different foods from all sorts of countries. From the US to France to Italy to Germany and Russia, this game had  245 recipies for foods from many countries and a discription on how to cook them. This game also features a kitchen timer, a list of recipies that can be catagorized by ingredients and step by step instructions with the chef's voice to help aid with cooking. I highly recommend this game for beginners and for people who aren't experienced with cooking.
Finding this (along with a GBA game in the same case) at a swap meet at a really competitive price, I'm surprised with how deep Professor Layton's brainteasers go.  The brainchild of psychology professor Akira Tago, the game takes an English gentleman and his eager young assistant to the bizarre village of St. Mystere.  Using the stylus from your DS system, you communicate with the eccentric locals, solve the puzzles and riddles they offer, and poke around the vicinity for hidden puzzles and coins to buy hints.  You're also given a briefcase where you keep clues that'll help in the long run.  As for the puzzles themselves, you don't have to be the Riddler to solve them.  Apart from basic match skills, they test the flexibility and patience of the player; emphasis on patience.  How many of us have thrown our hands up and logged on to YouTube for answers, only to realize we could've gotten it right all along?  Actually, my sole complaint is that the animated cutscenes look much choppier from the demo I played years earlier.  Still, if you're big on brainbusters then Professor Layton and the Curious Village is definitely your cup of tea (See what I did there?).This game is rated E for Everyone.
No matter how the game's cover may look to you, make no mistake that Professor Layton and the Curious Village is one of the best original puzzle games you'll play on the DS yet.  A combination of adventure storytelling and traditional puzzle gaming, Professor Layton never fails to entertain while providing some challenging puzzles.  The game revolves around said Professor Layton traveling to a small village with his young assistant Luke.  Both of whom are on a search for something called The Golden Apple.  To search the town, you move from one area to another by tapping the touch screen, and along the way, you can discover hidden puzzles, hint coins, and secrets, as well as interacting with the townspeople and solving more puzzles.  The game's graphics are incredibly charming, and the FMV sequences are very well done to boot.  The best part about Professor Layton and the Curious Village is that once you do beat the game and unlock the game's 120 plus puzzles, you can download weekly puzzles for absolutely free!  The only real flaw of Professor Layton and the Curious Village is that the game's music is repetitive and even kind of annoying, but you can always turn the volume of the DS down, which you might want to do.  That aside, don't let the box art fool you into thinking that this is a game just for kids.  Professor Layton and the Curious Village is an absolute must own for every puzzle loving DS owner.
As I have been a huge fan of the Professor Layton series ever since The Curious Village came out, naturally I got my hands on this as soon as it came out -- for I expected the pasts of Layton's nemesis Descole (villain of The Last Specter and Miracle Mask) to be revealed as well find out more about the Azran civilization. This game did not disappoint.Story: Professor Layton is invited by renowned archaeologist Professor Sycamore regarding a girl frozen for presumably over 1 million years. Upon their arrival at the frozen cave, the girl is found to be an emissary for an ancient and highly advanced Azran civilization. She requires 5 "keys" to unlock all the wisdom that the Azran left in their legacy. Having Layton and co. resolving mysteries around the world for Azran "keys" was a nice change to the same city setting in the previous games (save Diabolical Box). There are more twists in this than there are in the other games, to the point of using some cliched examples but were nonetheless engaging and astounding (I could never have guessed some of these developments).Gameplay: Per the usual, there are puzzles (150 in the main game) and several minigame puzzles for the player to solve. Upon completion of those, several harder puzzles will be open. Having played through all the Layton games, I found the puzzles in this game to be tougher than the puzzles in the other games. (I also spent more time playing this game than the others). Some puzzles are worded ambiguously but most are very well-done and would provide some challenging fun. There is also the added bonus of Daily Puzzles downloadable via Wi-Fi for an entire year.Visuals & music: Given that this is the last of the games featuring Professor Layton (Level 5 is planning a 7th game though), there are more beautifully animated cut-scenes and a wonderful soundtrack. The music in this game is my favorite in the Layton series.Overall, for fans of puzzles, adventure, and mysteries, this is a game you shouldn't miss. In addition, at the end of this game the opening sequence for The Curious Village ('07-08) is shown, making it clear that the events in this game took place before the first three Layton games released. So I would highly encourage those new to the series to play the Layton games in this order: The Last Specter -> Miracle Mask (3DS)-> Azran Legacy (3DS) -> Curious Village -> Diabolical Box -> Unwound Future.This is really a fitting end to this trilogy, and a sad parting for Professor Layton, even as he continues his adventures in Curious Village and beyond.

My daughter loves playing this game.  More suited for older children and young teens.  Would recommend for older children and young teens.
This was purchased as a Christmas gift for my daughter but since she was home for the holiday week-end I had her check it out.  Everything works perfectly.

Take control of NBA star Kobe Bryant, and recreate all his moves. All the moves including the out of this world slams were digitized from Kobe himself!! This game is a must have. Also, another cool thing about this game is the fact that it's PA Announcer is none other than the Lakers real-life PA Announcer!! When he yells Kobe's name after a basket, and also Shaq's name after a slam, it feels like a game at Staples Center! Talk about taking control!! This is the best as it gets! This game also has an arcade mode, which is 3 on 3 basketball! It also has a 3 point shootout! Take control of three point hotshots like Pat Garrity, Reggie Miller, and the 3 point king, Peja Stojakovic!!After you win a championship with the Lakers, you can take control of the other teams in the league, along with superstar players like Tracy McGrady, Kevin Garnett, Chris Webber, Gary Payton, and others! This game also has the grizzled vets like Karl Malone, Patrick Ewing, and his Airness, plus brash rookies like Brendan Haywood, Jamaal Tinsley, and Eddie Griffin!

WWT is the most innovative game I've ever played. There isn't much to say except, WOW!GAMEPLAY: Wario dishes hundreds of new microgames for you, but you control the game by moving the GBA/SP/DS like a steering wheel. One game has you twisting to avoid baseballs. The game even has built in vibration! Each character has their own unique way of playing.You also have bunches of souviners to unlock, ranging from records, mini-games, doodads, and more. It will take awhile to get everything.GRAPHICS: They look VERY good for a GBA game. Everything is crisp, clear, and colorful.SOUND/MUSIC: Another high-point. The game even has a neat song, Mona pizza. Sung by Wario's hot [better than Peach] girlfriend Mona!This here is Mona Pizza!Makers of the world's best eats-a!Fresh sauce and cheese gal-oreBrought straight to your front do-or!Yum! Yum! Yum! Yum!This here is Mona Pizza!Buon giornoMakers of our tasty treats-a!Buono!Our pie's crispy,crunchy cru-st...!Bellisima...Leaves others in the du-st!Mama Mia!Grab a hot slice ,and take a big bite!It's so good that you'll start a fight for more!Mona Pizza!My name is Joe!Mona Pizza!I'm the manager of this joint!Mona Pizza!It's a pizza art!Mona Pizza!I said-a "pizza art! Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha!We represent Pizza Dinosaur!We got the most stores in the world!Our crust is tough and our sauce is thin!But, we're everywhere, so you gotta give in!Mona Pizza's got nothing on us!

This is a game that is like N.F.L. Blitz, just hockey. Because of how it is very unrealistic. There are 3 players on the ice. Codes for using a hockey ball, or tennis ball. Goalies get checked, and can check. Players become on fire. You can be aliens, soldiers, poneys, totempoles, and about 20 others. There also are no penalties. This, though, is a fun game.

this game is rly kool.not only that yu can play games that shows yu magic,yu can also be dah magician.its lik,rly kool wen youre doing dah magic nd dah audience is totally clueless of how yu did it.dah thing that i dont rly lik about it is that yu hav to find audiences to perform dah tricks yu learned.it was difficult cuz its hard to find sumone.nd also,$20 is totally a great price.yu gotta buy it.=]
I think this game is absoulute perfection.The only thing I wish this game had was more player accuracy.Just like whenever you attack with a general he steps back and then thruste's forward.Well the player should have to press the the back button and then the forward button on the D-pad(direction pad).Anyway's you start of with a long intro and trust me every scene is long.You are a tactician who will help Lyn go through 10 lands.When I first got through Lyn's short 10 chapter's i was so mad because I thought the game was over.But it turn's out that after you finish Lyn's story mode you get Eliwood's story mode.Personally I think Eliwood's story mode is better since you get marcus(a strong paladin) on your team.There are 31 chapter's in all.And the cool thing about this game is that you get 32 character classes.There is a regular class and an advanced class. This is the regular, Knight,myrmidon,merceanery,cavalier,nomad,troubader,peagusesknight,wyvernrider,axefighter,archer,mage,shaman,monk,thief,and pirate. This is the advanced ,General,swordmaster,hero,paladin,nomadictrooper,  valkyrie,falconknight,wyvernlord,warrior,sniper,sage,druid,  bishop,assasin,and berserker.The classes are matched up so since knight is the first on the regulalar list a knight transforms into a general who is the first on the advanced list.Oh yeah,there is also the ultimate classes.Blademaster, greatlord,greatknight,arcshage,and dark druid.The ultimate class is not matched up with the other 2 classes.You get 3 lord's in the game.Hector(axefighter)Lyn(swordfighter)and Eliwood(swordfighter).There are multiple weapon's in the game.Lance's,sword's,axe's,bow's,animamagic,lightmagic,and darkmagic.It's sorta like rock,paper,scissors.Sword's beat axe's,lance's beat sword's and axe's beat lance's.Also anima beats light light beats dark(of course)and dark beat's anima.Bow's don't have a weakness but are good verses peaguses and wyvernrider's.The game really should have been rated for mild violence.And there is some death.Some people say the game has bad graphic's but their just talking about field graphic's.When you attack someone the graphic's are beautiful.And there are also critacle attack's that triple your damage.But I must warn you this game is very addictive.Sometimes I secretly stay up passed my bedtime just to play longer.And also when I get home from school I stay in the car an extra hour just to play.So in conclusion this game is awesome.  Later!!!

What happens when gaming guru, Shigeru  Miyamoto, is oppressed with the role as the integral man for masterminding the next Zelda and Metriod titles?  From the production of Pikmin, it seems as if he seizes a deep, consoling breath and rips open a bag full of relaxation.  Ah, finally all that dreadful anxiety and flagrant expectations from gaming fans everywhere wash away.  His sheer brilliance veers into a jaunty, animated dream world.  Conclusively, he creates a bizarre game where players are ferried  onto a planet where replicas of giant onions come alive and spawn multicolored, cutesy creatures called Pikmin.  Perhaps Miyamoto's latest game is a minor escape from the daunting task of transcending the GameCube into unreachable stratum?  Whatever the case, Pikmin is not what would we ordinarily expect as a first-class launch title, but it doesn't even fall short to deliver one addictive gem.The player assumes the responsibility of Captain Orima who looks like a freshly baked character from Cartoon Network.  With a big, round nose, a mini space outfit, and a fish bowl for a helmet, it's hard not to think about pummeling the daylights outta' the adorable twerp.  Orima's story is basically a cakewalk.  The captain opts to go on vacation through space, in the duration of his flight, he has a sensible meal of onions when a sudden meteor slams onto his rocket.  Surviving the plunge onto an alien planet, Orima's ship has disintegrated into fragments spread across the land.  He must now retrieve the primary ship parts with the aid of the affable and obedient Pikmin before his spacesuit loses function.Playing in Real Time, Pikmin, at the core, is a strategy game.  At the start, the player sets off with a single, trusty Pikmin and is required to feed a three-legged onion with pellets or butchered insects.  After a certain amount of nourishment, the onions plant seeds that'll eventually sprout as Pikmin.  The essential objective to the game is to manage the carrot-shaped Pikmin and lead them on an expedition throughout the planet to recover Captain Orima's missing ship parts.  There are three fundamental breeds of Pikmin, the red ones red are unscathed by fire, the blue ones wade over water, and the yellow ones cart one another and catapult themselves as organic grenades.  Micromanaging elements are also supplemented for good measure.  Bridges are to be constructed for faster mobilization, walls should be demolished for augmented exploration, and strategy preparation must be done to maintain  the life of the Pikmin.  Frequently, goliath-sized vermin like maggots intrude on the Pikmins` progression.  With a whistle command, Captain Orima can order his army to quit their current task, huddle together and unite for a defensive onset.  Also, the Pikmin may proceed in the offensive, attacking a monster when its simply dozing off.  The maximum number of Pikmin a player can shepherd is a grand total of 100 with absolutely no slowdown whatsoever.  Moreover, the game has a time limit.  Working as a clock, the l6 circles atop the screen move from left to right, and once the furthest one is filled, the day draws to a close.  At the end of each day, the Pikmin must rest overnight and an analysis of the player's personal army is evaluated.  Not particularly lengthy, the addicting game can be whizzed within a jiffy of hours.  Crammed with bonus and high score modes, the game retains a good, extended platter of replayability.  What Miyamoto has done is sculpt the GameCube's first true classic.The GameCube's controller, feeling a bit tweaky at first, succeeds to superbly make a first-rate control scheme.  Captain Orima can be directed individually or accompanied with personal escorts.  The analog stick guides Captain Orima, the A button yanks Pikmin from the soil, the B joins Pikmin together, the X is used to distinguish Pikmin groups into separate colors, and the Y button looms the game information and map.  Additionally, the game's camera can be modified in any direction the player fancies, whether it be overhead, side, or the front.The second Pikmin invades the television screen, the player will irrefutably remark on how the graphics are gorgeously crafted or converged with intoxicating vivacity.  From what I have gathered from the many opinions of other gamers, players will either breath in revulsion or approval.  Technology-wise, the rich world of Pikmin is matchless.  With the control of the camera, the player can zoom in and out, screening through the huge landscapes.  Even the tiniest of details will stimulate the players imagination, like the vast region of mountains and shrubbery.  If not enchanting, the game's surroundings adequately present an overall smooth, graphical touch.  From the lighting, various shadowing, and sheer multitude of animation on the creatures, Pikmin is what I imagine as a tingly trip to la-la land.  Ironically, I felt a bit queasy after a few hours on this colorful madness.  While marveling and vacuuming your life on Pikmin, the players will notice how well the music suits this type of genre.  Indolent, tranquil sounds engulf the environment and is deliberately welcomed.  There are the congenial tunes of a pristine day materializing, and the placid kind which hails approaching slumber.  When an antagonistic intruder stumbles upon the Pikmins' camp, the music is swapped into a more rapid, upbeat tempo.  The musical score  proves to be finely executed.  The eccentric yet delightful sounds from the Pikmin, the battle cries, and other noises add deeply to this already remarkable game.Pikmin's basic gist is to genuinely refresh audiences with  entertaining amusement along with hours of nonstop gameplay.  Throughout the game I found myself beaming at the antics of Captain Orima and how ridiculously hilarious the Pikmin behave.  Initially when a tremendous, next-generation home console is released, a monster of a game convoys along, and although,  Nintendo honcho, Shigeru Miyamoto should have unleashed godhood, a Zelda or Star Fox game, Pikmin does not disappoint and is well worth the ownership for the novel, bold GameCube.

Pikmin was created from Zelda's daddy, Shigeru Miyameto. Pikmin is about a guy from Earth who accidently crash-landed on a very strange and unusual planet filled with alien creatures that view the guy nothing less than breakfast, lunch, brunch, dinner, dessert, or a midnight snack. But later on when you look around, you find the "Pikmin", little alien creatures that are attracted to anything that pulls them out from the ground. The Pikmin are as loyal as dogs and will do whatever you order them to do. For example, if you tell them to kill a huge mushroom monster, they'll do it without complaining even if killing it means to get eaten themselves. You must repair your spaceship because the atmosphore is toxic to your little character. The game is intruging and innoventive from the start. People may say it's too kiddy but the game is meant to be played by all generations. (...) So in conclusion, Pikmin proves that Shigeru Miyameto is a mastermind at making video games.

The graphics are piss-poor but the game play and music rarely get better.Bulbasaur is better than any other starter ever and always will be. Charmander was cute but not as cool. And Squirtle as adorable as he was was way too slow.The madness never stopped in my house once me and my bro (22 and 16 now) got these into our grubby paws. We did next to no trading, but tons of gaming.33 Pokemon that are in this title are:Bulbasaur, Meowth, Persian, Starmie, Dragonair, Koffing, Weezing, Ekans, Arbok, Seel, Dewgong, Zapdos, Geodude, Graveler, Golem, Vulpix, Vileplume, Articuno, Electabuzz, Ponyta, Gloom, Tangela, Lickitung, Mewtwo, Chansey, Taurus, Jynx, Oddish, Golbat, Horsea, Dragonite, Diglett and Magmar.It's only better because Pikachu follows you everywhere, has a feelings meter and can surf if you know how to access it. Also, an extra point because Team Rocket unsuccessfully crashes your party. Priceless, really. And *JUST* like the anime. =^)Game play : A-Sound : B-Originality : D- (bit off of Blue and Red's style like Woah. The only thing remotely original was the fact that your yellow, adorable Pikachu followed you and he surfed.And remember the 3 starters from Blue/Red (Bulba, Charm and Squirt? If you play your cards right you can have them all, helping create a wonderous team to be reckoned with! Also Team Rocket tried and failed each time to ambush your journey throughout Kanto! &lt;/X^D)Story: C-Trading : A-Fun : AReplay : A++Overall : B-4.1 stars.

Sometimes going the 3rd party route for game accessories is an okay deal.  However, when choosing a memory card that'll save the data you worked hard for, the Memory Card should be chosen well.Comparison to 3rd Party:Many times, 3rd party brand memory cards promise much space.  For the price, they hold a large amount of game files.  Sadly, many times people lose their data.  Either they are corrupted, it refuses to recognize the card or it keeps asking to reformat the card.  The errors are more consistant, and so far I have never once had a problem with losing my data on the official Gamecube Memory Card by Nintendo.  Buy 3rd Party Memory Cards at your own risk.Comparing less memory versus 251 slots:If you are on a tight budget, (as many gamers are) buying the official Nintendo Memory Card of 59 slots may seem the best way to go.  Sure you get 59 slots, and you feel as if it'll last long enough, but it never seems to.  Sure the 59 slot memory card is roughly $5.00 less, but you are getting significanly less space.  The 251 memory card has 4x the space of the 59 space one.Let's do the Math:251 slots for around: $2059 slots for around: $15Buying the 59 slot Memory Card 4 Times Gives you This:236 Slots for around $60----Overall, buy the official Nintendo Memory Card with 251 slots and you will not only get quality but save money in the long run.

It's about time Nintendo came out with a sizable memory unit that can hold large amount of information. Before now, one had to rely off-brand cards (such as the Nyko 8 MB) for large saves, and they were susceptible to data corruption and the loss of saves. A basic save of Madden, MVP Baseball, or any of the Sims games often took up most of a regular 251 block card. Saving more than that--a season or franchise--was only possible with off-brand cards whose record of reliability was tenuous at best. (Imagine saving a season of Madden and losing it when the card became corrupted). Nintendo-brand cards have an excellent record of stability and reliability. If you need a large card for saving sports or Sims games, this is perfect.

The Nintendo Memory Card 59 is a must for all gamecube owners.  Due to the disc-based games that the Gamecube uses, you need a memory card to save your progress.I highly recommend buying a memory card like this that is made by Nintendo instead of a memory card by a third-party company that may be a few dollars cheaper or bigger because they are notorious for losing data.  I have never had trouble losing data from a Nintendo memory card.One note of warning is this:  If you already have a memory card and plan on getting an extra or something, wait until the Nintendo Memory Card 251 comes out in a few weeks.  The memory card 251 is almost five times bigger than the memory card 59, but it will sell for about the same price.

The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages can be a sequel or a beggining to The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons. In this game Nayru, a sorceress, (you may know her from Zelda: The Ocarina of Time) has been kidnapped by an evil sorceress named Veran. Veran has traveled back in time and you must stop her. In order to go back in time, you need the Harp of Ages. You get some help from some animals, Dimitri the Dodongo, Moosh the winged polar bear, and Ricky the boxing kangaroo.

This is one of the best games!  You have to play it.  It is definitely the best game in the Zelda series so far.  It has adventure, romance, mystery, and SO many subquests.  It's about a boy named Link who has a destiny.  He lives in Kokiri Village, a little tiny village in the land of Hyrule.  Anyway, a little fairy named Navi comes and says that he must meet the Deku Tree.  He does and the Deku Tree tells him to go inside the Deku Tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him.  Link does this and the Deku Tree gives him the Kokiri Emerald, or the Spiritual Stone of Forest.  The Deku Tree phrophesies that Ganondorf, an evil desert Gerudo man, is trying to get hold of the Triforce, the essence of life in Hyrule.  But in order to get hold of the Triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones.  Unfortuantely, after the tree's prophecy, he died because of the curse Ganondorf had cast upon him.  But Link and Navi go on their journey and get the Goron's Ruby, or Spiritual Stone of Fire and the Zora's Sapphire, or Spiritual Stone of Water.  Link gets the Ocarina of Time but when he opens the doors Ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the Triforce.  Link waits seven years in the Chamber of Time and when he awakes he's all grown up.  Rauru, the Sage of Light is there and tells him that he must save all the Sages from their temples and receive the medallions.  He receives the Medallion of Light, Forest, Fire, Water, Shadow, and Spirit.  But the game.  It's definitely one of the best N64 games around!
Ok I am continuing my reviews for The Zelda games I own cause I don't own every Zelda game. This Zelda game is without a doubt favorite Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past Which for any of those who don't know was suppose to be called Zelda III The Triforce Saga. But since The NES was near the end of it's life span Nintendo decided to go for The SNES. If any game deserves the title of Zelda III cause I think of the 1st 2 Zelda games on The NES & A Link To The Past as a Triforce Saga. Now after Zelda II wasn't what everybody wanted even though I didn't mind it they decided to go back to an overhead view & drop The RPG elements go back to using Rupee's & weapons instead of using all magic attacks. If I could give this game all the stars in the world I would if I am a fanboy for this game then color me a fanboy. I played this game a lot along with Mario All Stars & Street Fighter II Turbo back in the day. Even now hearing about all the glitches & preforming them this game is feels fresh & this game is 21 years old. This game brings a lot to the table like the tone which would be used in Ocarina Of Time & big time in Majora's Mask as well for Twilight Princess. This game started the dark tone in a Zelda games. You have this character Aghnim he not only collects the money from The King for helping him he then kills The King & takes these Maidens that are ancestors to The Wise Men he seals them into The Dark World. The Dark World is the land where The Triforce is at people who go to The Dark World don't come back & they change shape. It's a twisted version of Hyrule. Link is framed by Aghnim a kid gets sick from the evil air coming from Death Mountain. You have this kid who plays the flute who is dead. The next reviews I do for The Zelda games will go more in depth this game was released in Japan in 1991 & a few months later in The Spring of 92 The name of this game in Japan is The Legend Of Zelda The Triforce Of The Gods. The story is Ganon tries to get his hands on The Triforce he enters The Golden Land The King has 7 Wise Men put a seal on the enterance to The Golden Land which it seems that he's been sealed there forever. Hundreds of years later a drought a famine & illnesses have spread through Hyrule The King thought it had something to do with The Golden Land but the seal was intact a Wizard or a Satanic Priest however you want to look at I prefer what Aghnim was in The Japanese version. Aghnim shows up & ends the problems with Hyrule, The King was looking for decendents of The 7 Wise Men Aghnim helped him find them then he got a big role in The Kingdom Aghnim's intentions came clear he murdered The King Of Hyrule put a mind control spell on The Guards had The Maidens rounded up & sent them to The Dark World which this is all told in the opening & it really showed off the power of The SNES plus that music by Koji Kondo is great which ALTTP is my favorite Zelda score Ocarina Of Time is 2nd the opening music where it shows Aghnim sending The Madiens to The Dark World scared me as a kid.[...]Princess Zelda is locked up she sends out a telepathic message 1 of the people who get it is Link & this is not The same Link from the 1st 2 games & this is not the Zelda you save from the 1st game or the sleeping Zelda from part II. Link's Uncle decides he's going to see what that Aghnim guy is up to he tells Link not to leave the house. Well he does anyway you head for The Castle & find a secret passageway where you find your Uncle has been badly injured he gives you his sword & shield he never finish'e his sentence & there is a lot of debate about what he wants to say he says Princess Zelda is your a lot people say he is going to say your Sister. Link might have a connection to The Royal Family cause in the novel his father was a knight but Zelda being his sister I doubt it. So the 1st thing you have to do is save Zelda & get her to this Church so she can be hid. You have to find 3 Pendants that will allow you to get The Master Sword this game introduces The Master Sword. You'll have a few side quests to get items you need to get to each dungeon or will help you complete it The Light World Dungeon music is another track that scared me as a kid[...]Also Aghnim has framed you for kidnapping Princess Zelda when you get The Master Sword Guards have taken Zelda killed The Priest so you have to head into the area of the castle where you weren't allowed to enter before cause The Master Sword can break the seal. Aghnim makes you watch as he sends Zelda to The Dark World. When you face Aghnim you can't fight him head on you have to play Dead Man's Volley as it's called. When he's beat Aghnim draws you into The Dark World & if you have The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera then you won't change shape into a bunny. Going back can be a hassle. This man you meet before the 1st Light World Dungeon Sahasrahla contacts you telepathically & that you have to free all The Maidens & Zelda & that is the only way defeating Aghnim & Ganon. The Dark World has no human's everyone has been turned into a beast or some kind of animal that represents what's in their mind & heart. It might be best to try to upgrade your weapons whenever you can like you shield & you can upgrade The Master Sword when you save this Blacksmith who is trapped in The Dark World. You can get a powerful Golden Sword near the end. The Boomerange can be powered up to reach further when you keep throwing in rupee's to summon a Great Fairy. I like how you can increase the number of arrows & bombs you can carry. The Silver Arrow's return too mainly to defeat Ganon. Other items you need is like from The Desert Temple The Power Glove that allows you to pick up heavy rocks. In the 4th dark world dungeon you get The Titan's Mitt that let's you pick up even heavier rocks & stones. I mentioned you must get The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera cause it allows you to keep your human form in The Dark World. Another must have item to even get to the 2nd temple is The Pegasus Boots that Sahasrahla. that let's you move faster & you have to use them to knock The Book Of Madora off a book shelf in Kakariko Village which that book is the only way you can enter The Desert Temple. The 3 Medallions you get are very handy. The items you get in The Dark World such as the hammer in the 1st Dark World dungeon The Hookshot in the 2nd Dark World Dungeon. The Fire Rod in The Forest Temple in The Dark World. The Titan's Mitt mentioned about already in the 4th Dark World dungeon. Then in the 5th Dark World dungeon you get The Blue Mail that reduces the amount of damage you take. The 6th Dark World dungeon contains The Cane Of Somaria that create these blocks that can weigh switches down it can also get create a block that can get you to the other side of the room like in Turtle Rock. Also in Turtle Rock you get The Mirror Shield. In Ganon's Tower you obtain The Red Mail which reduces the amount of damage you take even more. Basically you need all the items to complete the game such as The Ice Rod, Zora Flippers, The Magic Cape, Cane Byrna. There are a couple of side quests that stand out in my mind like the 1 where you get the flute there is this old man & his grandson is missing there is this boy that looks similar to Link & anytime you approach him he disappears it's cause he's dead. In The Dark World you find this animal or whatever it is standing on a tree stump you find out that is Flute Boy cause he went to The Dark World & was killed. With this flute you now have access to a bird that will fly you place to place & this lost old man in the caves leading to Death Mountain & he gives you the mirror that can take you back to The Light World. This game is 1 of the 1st times I believe that Nintendo allowed death in their games. So the game started a dark tone in Zelda games. I mentioned the glitches & how they made this game feels fresh I tried them out there kind of funny like you can face Aghnim while you have Zelda with you & Aghnim is sending Zelda to The Dark World it's like you got Zelda out of her cell so who is Ganon sending to The Dark World. Plus you know it's night time when you start the game & it's raining well if you do the glitch where you beat the game in like 5 minutes then in the ending it's night time & it's still raining. My favorite glitch is where you have the mirror & The Moon Peral ok & you can keep going back & forth from The Light World to The Dark World near the broken bridge & you can explore The Dark World before you even face Aghnim the 1st time. Just make sure you have the mirror, The Moon Peral & The Master Sword. Stuff you have to figure out like how to get The Big Key or the item in each dungeon is great. The bosses were all good The Ball & Chain Trooper who is in the castle. To The Armos Knights which a lot of fun. The boss of The Desert Temple Twinmola it's a good pattern type boss. The Tower Of Hera Moldorm is annoying cause if it knocks you off the ledge then you got to fight the boss all over again. The 1st Aghnim fight is good cause you have to knock it's attacks back at him. The Dark World dungeon bosses are well done some are harder than others such as Arrghus, Mothela, The Blind Thief & Trinexx. The 1st Dark World dungeon boss isn't too hard Helmasaur King you just use your hammer bust away at the metal on his face & fire arrows at the middle of it's head. In The 2nd Dark World Dungeon you battle Arrghus who is a big eyeball surrounded by several small eyes which you have to use The Hookshot to pull the eyes away & slash away with The Master Sword until you have to fight the giant eye. Mothula in The 3rd Dark World Dungeon while difficult all you need is The Fire Rod to beat it. The Blind Thief is hard cause it has 2 or 3 heads attacking you. In The 5th Dark World dungeon you face Kholdstare which is kind of a pain. You also have to have the bird to get to The 6th Dark World dungeon & the boss is Vitreous who is sort of like Arrghus but not as hard. To get into Turtle Rock you have to have The Quake Medallion & to get through it you have to have The Cane Of Somaria. This dungeon is a big pain cause you have to light torches to open some doors & if 1 torch goes out then the door will close. The boss Trinexx in it's 1st phase where you use The Fire & Ice Rod's isn't hard when you fight in it's 2nd phase then it's more of a challenge & I recommend that you get plenty of red or blue potion or some fairies on hand for The Dark World dungeon bosses. When you beat The 7 Dark World dungeon youu free a Maiden & finally Princess Zelda. Which takes you to Ganon's Tower where you fight the 3 Light World dungeon bosses again & have the 2nd & final encounter with Aghnim. Which the 2nd battle with Agahnim is a little bit harder. The final boss is Ganon & Ganon is the hardest of any Zelda game cause it takes 4 Silver Arrow's this time instead of 1 & when stomps the floor the ends start to break off & if you're knocked off the ledge you have to start the battle all over again. I think A Link To The Past Ganon is harder than Ganon in The NES original or Ocarina Of Time. But when you beat Ganon you are treated to a great ending. I know this has been a long read & I said my next reviews for The Zelda games are going to be really long so just a warning. This game is amazing bottom line while love Ocarina Of Time & enjoyed Majora's Mask & Twilight Princess this still remains my favorite Zelda game. If you never played Legend Of Zelda A Ling To The Past you should & play it any way you can cause you will miss out on 1 of the best games of the 90's
Ok I am continuing my reviews for The Zelda games I own cause I don't own every Zelda game. This Zelda game is without a doubt favorite Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past Which for any of those who don't know was suppose to be called Zelda III The Triforce Saga. But since The NES was near the end of it's life span Nintendo decided to go for The SNES. If any game deserves the title of Zelda III cause I think of the 1st 2 Zelda games on The NES & A Link To The Past as a Triforce Saga. Now after Zelda II wasn't what everybody wanted even though I didn't mind it they decided to go back to an overhead view & drop The RPG elements go back to using Rupee's & weapons instead of using all magic attacks. If I could give this game all the stars in the world I would if I am a fanboy for this game then color me a fanboy. I played this game a lot along with Mario All Stars & Street Fighter II Turbo back in the day. Even now hearing about all the glitches & preforming them this game is feels fresh & this game is 21 years old. This game brings a lot to the table like the tone which would be used in Ocarina Of Time & big time in Majora's Mask as well for Twilight Princess. This game started the dark tone in a Zelda games. You have this character Aghnim he not only collects the money from The King for helping him he then kills The King & takes these Maidens that are ancestors to The Wise Men he seals them into The Dark World. The Dark World is the land where The Triforce is at people who go to The Dark World don't come back & they change shape. It's a twisted version of Hyrule. Link is framed by Aghnim a kid gets sick from the evil air coming from Death Mountain. You have this kid who plays the flute who is dead. The next reviews I do for The Zelda games will go more in depth this game was released in Japan in 1991 & a few months later in The Spring of 92 The name of this game in Japan is The Legend Of Zelda The Triforce Of The Gods. The story is Ganon tries to get his hands on The Triforce he enters The Golden Land The King has 7 Wise Men put a seal on the enterance to The Golden Land which it seems that he's been sealed there forever. Hundreds of years later a drought a famine & illnesses have spread through Hyrule The King thought it had something to do with The Golden Land but the seal was intact a Wizard or a Satanic Priest however you want to look at I prefer what Aghnim was in The Japanese version. Aghnim shows up & ends the problems with Hyrule, The King was looking for decendents of The 7 Wise Men Aghnim helped him find them then he got a big role in The Kingdom Aghnim's intentions came clear he murdered The King Of Hyrule put a mind control spell on The Guards had The Maidens rounded up & sent them to The Dark World which this is all told in the opening & it really showed off the power of The SNES plus that music by Koji Kondo is great which ALTTP is my favorite Zelda score Ocarina Of Time is 2nd the opening music where it shows Aghnim sending The Madiens to The Dark World scared me as a kid.[...]Princess Zelda is locked up she sends out a telepathic message 1 of the people who get it is Link & this is not The same Link from the 1st 2 games & this is not the Zelda you save from the 1st game or the sleeping Zelda from part II. Link's Uncle decides he's going to see what that Aghnim guy is up to he tells Link not to leave the house. Well he does anyway you head for The Castle & find a secret passageway where you find your Uncle has been badly injured he gives you his sword & shield he never finish'e his sentence & there is a lot of debate about what he wants to say he says Princess Zelda is your a lot people say he is going to say your Sister.

****WARNING, SPOILERS INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW****I feel as though I should offer something of an explanation as to my decision to wax philosophical on a title that is as old, honored, and tested as Earthbound. Granted, retro-reviews are indeed all the rage, but I cannot say that I have been moved to ever actually commit to a write-up on one before. There are certainly other games that, as an experience, are by far more readily cited as an example of technical or artistic merit.That's the issue, though: Earthbound is not so much a technical achievement or artistic triumph as it is an experience, a part of one man's life story told in a surreal third person. Shigesato Itoi, Earthbound's creator, undertook a profoundly personal journey, choosing to tell the tale of childhood utilizing his most familiar medium - game design. The result was a journey so profound that those with even the most tenuous grasp of childhood emotions, sensations and innocent awe could not help but walk away without feeling its effects.For a game with the original title of Mother 2, perhaps this childish world view is simply par for the course. In Earthbound, the world is on the brink of ruin; Giygas, an alien entity, has grown strong thanks to the darkness of the world. Its corruption, hatred, greed, violence and depravity eventually allow him to grow powerful and conquer the world. A sentient bee named Buzz Buzz, a resistance fighter of a distant future, travels back in time (to our present) to find a young boy who was said to have the power to defeat Giygas before the alien's strength becomes insurmountable.That young boy is Ness, an average kid from Onett who lives with his mother, sister, and dog. Ness's father, while constantly away on business, can be reached by phone, and provides pithy guidance to his son and maintains his savings account. (The implications regarding absentee fathers are hardly understated in Earthbound, but seek to offer a comforting picture of positive maturity to children. Fathers are important, the game tells us, but so much that their presence - or lack thereof - need not define your identity or sense of self-worth.)You travel throughout the world, battling all manner of whimsical (and sometimes down-right terrifying) foes who have been corrupted by Giygas's all-pervading influence. The player will meet friends who share their goal, and eventually they will overcome many obstacles and face off against Giygas him/itself. However, even this "final confrontation" is hardly the over-wrought clich&eacute; that one might assume.In fact, the battle is one of video game-dom's most famous, and with good reason. What makes the final battle with Giygas so amazing, so profound, is its summation of the childhood journey. While we are given some details of Giygas in Mother, there is very little that we know about him, especially regarding his metamorphosis into the embodiment of evil, fear, and hatred. What is Giygas? Even in his mindless state of complete hatred, he seems lost, hurt...like a child calling out for his mother.Perhaps if we look at Itoi's inspiration for the final confrontation with the End of All Things, we can gain an appreciation for his conception of innocence, and indeed, the gray that lies between the black and white absolutes of established morality. This is no mere quest to topple the villain, but an examination of the journey itself, which is captured on numerous occasions by an itinerant photographer to remind you of your travels and experiences with friends. At game's end, it feels almost like a scrapbook, and one cannot but help and reflect on their childhood adventures, as well.Earthbound is a tremendous game, and an even greater examination of the creator's own worldview. In that, it is impossible not to see something of ourselves in the game, of our own years of innocent wonder, those that led, inexorably, to maturation and knowledge. To top it all off, it is also a solid RPG, though some might find its mechanics to be "dated" by modern standards. Others will find comfort in its old-school charm, and use it as it was intended - as a vehicle through one of the greatest narratives not only in gaming, but modern media.

Earthbound for the Super Nintendo may very well epitomize the term "cult classic" more than any other game ever made. It fits all the criteria: Oddball game design that most mainstream gamers will find too strange for their liking, lacking sales and critical disapproval at the time of it's release, a small-but-devoted following, hefty price tag, constant rumors about incredibly rare beta versions, sequels, etc., and most importantly, a really interesting game underneath.Earthbound is a traditional 16-bit RPG dragged through an insane LSD and pop culture gutter. The swords and staves are replaced with frying pans and yo-yo's. The fantasy worlds of Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger are replaced with a modern-day world with a zany sense of humor. You fight against hippies, businessman, ants, mushrooms, and abstract art. You order "zombie paper" from a pizzeria to save a zombie infested town. And you recieve your opening mission statement from a...bee. Not only do these ideas keep the game fresh, they also are used to satirize many of the more overly serious aspects of RPGs.The battle system is pretty basic, but it works well, with character-unique abilities, PSI powers, and a "roll-back" H.P. system that rewards players with fast fingers. The lack of random battles is also a welcome surprise. Be warned, though: the game is unusually tough, and is very unforgiving towards unprepared or impatient players. With a little practice, however, you'll be able to tackle the more threatening battles without getting too banged up.There are a few flaws: Mainly, the items don't stack, meaning you're oftentimes running out of room to place things. Also, the diffuclty could be adjusted so that the normal enemies are easier and the bosses are harder, but it's not too much of a problem.Anyone who is tired of "normal" video games should check this one out, but be prepared to search abit, or pay upwards of $75.

This version of Super Mario Kart lacks the cleverness of the newer versions for the more modern consoles, but in my opinion the PvP action in this one is easier to assimilate and easier to navigate which means the business of bursting each other's balloons is the primary objective, not constantly trying to *find* each other.This boils down to the chances of prolonged nail-biting chases and well-earned escapes (or well-earned kills) is higher, where on the newer versions the sudden ambush is the chief encounter type.I can't speak for you but I much prefer to be in chases or duels, in close contact with the enemy as soon and for as long as possible so that tactical driving skill is paramount.Possibly the best use of a Super NES.

This game is one of those games that you will keep playing until the next line of consoles come out.  This game is hectic one player and even more hectic if you bring friends over.  There is the engine size like in all MK games (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, etc.) the higher the CC the faster you go and the harder the AI is.  after choosing your cc you get to choose your characters and your kart.  You get two characters per kart each charaacter with a special item (baby mario gets chain chomp, DK gets big banana, etc.). after choosing your characters from the list of 16+ you choose your kart.  The karts are sorted by weight class (light, medium, heavy).  your characters determine what weight class you are in, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.  after that you choose between 4 cups (mushroom, flower, star, and special) each with 4 tracks in them.  by getting golds in the cups you unlock new content like extra battle tracks and characters.speaking of battle this is one of the best parts.  get your friends together and blow them up in one of three battle types (shine thief, bob-omb blast, and classic balloon battle).  in shine thief you want to take control of the shine until the timer reaches zero, get the shine by hitting them with shells, banana peel, or whatever else.  in bob-omb blast every question mark block is a bomb and you blow each other up first to 3 or 4 hits wins.  In balloon battle you have three balloons and the last one with any balloons wins.  Knock your friends out by shooting them with shells to make their balloons fly away.All in all i think this game is one of the best on the gamecube and i recomend it to all gamecube owners.

The concept of racing games always grabs the attention of everyone, even those who have never played on a game console. Mario Kart Double Dash (MKDD) not only grabs you, but also hooks you with its ingenous racetracks, colorful and funny karts and their favorite trademark characters.This game is one of the few to take advantage of the broadband adapter (sold separately). The broadband setup allows up to 8 players to play simultaneously using 8 separate TVs and consoles (requires an 8-port hub with patch cables), or 8 players on 2 TVs(4 players per TV) using 2 consoles (requires only a cross over cable to connect the 2 consoles). These kind of setups are fantastic for a LAN party or even a MKDD tournament.Racing in this game is now a cooperative effort, there's the driver and the thrower on the same kart. Characters are classified as light(e.g. Baby Luigi), medium (e.g. Yoshi) or heavy(e.g. Bowser). There are also three (3) corresponding kart types. Any combination of driver/thrower is possible but they can ride only on a kart as big as the heaviest character in the pair. Light karts accelerate fast, but are weak when colliding against heavier karts, and they don't have great top speeds. Heavy karts accelerate slowly, but they are strong and have the highest top speeds. This character/kart combination allows the player to experiment and find the best pair for him/her.The main event is the grand prix competition. In this event you race against human and/or computer opponents trying to reach the goal first not only with speed but by using your wits. Special items such as banana peels or green shells, among others, are scattered all over the tracks for you to pick up. Each item gives you a strategic advantage that if used wisely can make a difference at the end of the race.Apart from the grand prix competition there are also other race modes such as time trials (to measure how fast you finish a track), versus (race against human players only) and battle, which also has its own variations. These game modes combined with multiplayer capabilities makes this game entertaining for a long period.How many character are there to choose? Well, there are 16, but who knows if there is some kind of code to unlock others.How many karts? There are 8, but you unlock others as you start winning grand prix tournaments.If you want clean, fun entertainment for the whole family then this one is a winner.

I simply loved the first Golden Sun, but this game was phenonomal! If you played the first game you pretty much know what's going to happen in this game, but WHO CARES! The main idea throuhout the game is that Felix and his gang (Felix, Jenna, Sheba, and Piers) are attempting to light the Jupiter and Mars Lighthouses and restore Alchemy to the world. Gain new psynergies, fight intimidating bosses, and team up with Issac and company and light the remaining lighthouses!

I loved Golden Sun, so I was very excited about playing this sequel.  At first, I was disappointed because you are no longer the character in the first game.  In fact, you won't hook up with Isaac and the gang until way into this game.  You are now Felix, the kid who was swept away in a stream back in Vale and who seemingly joined the darkside but, since you are now taking control of his character, he must not have been so bad after all.  So, instead of starting out with Isaac, Garet, Ivan, and Mia with their level 31 powers, you need to start all over again with a new posse of characters.  I guess this makes sense as you do not need to complete the GS1 to play Lost Age.  The first team will have all the powers you gained for them in the first game, but they won't be needed too much.  Djinn Flash and Granite and some of Ivan's psynergy will pretty much be the only pivotal things they bring to the group.There are several things different about Lost Age than GS1.  First, I found that I used attack Djinn much more often in battles.  I almost never used psynergy to fight.  Psynergy was almost exclusively used for performing tasks and solving puzzles.  You get a lot of new psynergy like Tremor, Scoop, Pound, Sand, Cyclone, Hover, Blaze, Burst, Teleport, and Parch.I also noticed that I hardly bought any weapons, armor, or healing items.  Most of the stuff I used I found (including the ultra powerful Sol Blade), earned in battle, or won at the Contigo slots.  Consequently, you can amass a ton of coins (coins were much more precious when I played GS1).  One of the most useful purchases will be Mist Potions in Prox near the end of the game in preparation for your final showdown, and money will be no object by then.  I had almost 415,000 coins before my final boss battle, over double what I had in GS1.Another difference about this game is you'll be able to travel by ship to different continents.  This ship will also have wings built on it so you can fly over certain barriers (alas, not all barriers).You get a better idea what's going on here, too.  It seems that, because the lighthouses are not lit, there is no longer enough elemental energy to grow and sustain the world.  A map reveals that the continents of the world are shrinking.  The beacons of the four lighthouses thus must be lit (Venus will be lit at the beginning of the game).  Isaac and the gang did not know this in GS1.A lot of things I loved about GS1 are in Lost Age.  There are many different places to see and things to do.  There is also excellent music that changes with almost every place you go.  The melancholy music in Garoh fits the tale of the lycanthropes who take the form of werewolves because they borrow powers from beasts and are, therefore, often considered beasts is a beautiful combination.  I kept that part saved on my game for a long time.  You can also save the game anytime, except during battles, which is an incredibly useful feature.Another similarity to GS1 is that, in LA, the toughest battle is not the last.  It is the Star Magician on Treasure Island.  I would not tackle it right away.  I would wait until you find the powerful Sol Blade in the Mars Lighthouse on the other side of the world and backtrack to Treasure Island.  The Star Magician is aided by four balls (or spheres, if you will).  You need to defeat his strongest spheres in the following order of priority: 1. Guardian Spheres, 2. Refresh Sphere, 3. Anger Spheres.  Only after the magician has 4 Thunder Spheres do you attack him.  Unlike other boss battles, you do not use summons.  Set all your Djinni, and attack with Felix's Sol Blade.  Sheba and Piers should alternate Flash and Granite.  I tried Shade instead of Granite but it did not work.  Shade allows a little more damage which is just enough to prevent me from keeping my guys alive.  Jenna should either be using Flower or healing psynergy.  She should also have some Mist Potions and Waters of Life just in case (maybe divide them up between Felix and Jenna).  This strategy will take a long time--maybe 45 minutes--but it will work eventually.  If it goes right, you won't even need to use Isaac's team.  It took me many tries to beat this dude.  Incidentally, you do not need to defeat the magician to beat the game, but why not go for it?!  This strategy will also work in the final boss, the Doom Dragon.Another difficult part was a room full of Hover pads in the Jupiter Lighthouse.  You have to stay above the Hover pads to keep hovering but a whirlwind will force you onto some broken tiles and, if you're there too long (which seems like just a nanosecond), you'll fall through the floor and have to start all over again.  After many tries and many swear words, I discovered that if you leave the hover pads and return to them at a angle, you'll shave off just enough time to make it.  I did this twice, to the right to activate one of the statues to the lighthouse, and to the left to pick up the Phaeton Blade, which was the most powerful weapon I had found up to that point.  As it turns out, the Phaeton Blade is not that powerful compared to other weapons you will get and I ended up selling it so you really only need to conquer the Hover pads once on the right side of the room and save yourself the frustration of having to do it twice.The end of the game was neat but I was a little disappointed because I was looking forward to returning to Vale (the first town in GS1).  Seeing that town again with that old music would be a real treat.  As it turns out, that will be impossible.  Oh well, I'm more nostalgic than most.  I definitely recommend beating GS1 before playing Lost Age, although it is not necessary.  I think you will love this game so much you'll want to play both, so you might as well play them in order.  As always, get a walkthrough!  Good luck, adept.

Excelente juego. Es muy diferente a cualquier juego de v&iacute;deo. Obliga a pensar y a moverse, dos cosas que en los v&iacute;deo juegos son muy escasas. los gr&aacute;ficos son simples, pero no se necesita mas. la m&uacute;sica es muy adictiva y divertida. Claro esta que uno no aguanta jugar por horas este juego, pero si lo anima a jugar un poco todos los d&iacute;as para seguir avanzando y eso es muy bueno con los ni&ntilde;os que normalmente se quedan pegados a un juego por horas.
Este no es el juego tradicional de mover el control. Este es el juego de mover el cerebro y luego mover el control. Muy sencillo, muy divertido y permite jugar en familia. Tiene muchas opciones y es muy divertido. Mis hijos y yo lo jugamos juntos todo el tiempo y me gusta por que no me aburre y no los aburre a ellos.
Es el juego que m&aacute;s les gust&oacute; a mis hijos de verdad que es sencillo pero muy entretenido. Adem&aacute;s Mario & Luigi hacen la diversi&oacute;n instant&aacute;nea.

An amazing acci&oacute;n adventure game; with beautiful videos telling you the story. Most of the game is like an old 2D world, you can chance to first person view almos any time and you must do sometimes.Un extraordinario juego que regresa mucho a las raices de Metroid, juegas en 2D y muchas veces puedes y otras debes cambiar a perspectiva de primera persona. Videos muy bien hechos que te cuentan la historia, acci&oacute;n y aventura en un gran juego.Lo recomiendo mucho si te gustan los juegos cl&aacute;sicos o de este tipo.

The Wii Fit is a great addition to the Wii system, while it is not a substitute to get out and hitting the gym or doing some road miles, it is a fun way of getting into a home exercise routine. If you don't have a Yoga instructor handy, the Wii provides one for one, including some fun and tough poses. The four areas of training on the Fit, other than the Yoga are Strength, Aerobics and the Balance games. The strength training is cool, I generally never bothered with push-ups until now, that and other exercises you can include your own free-weights with are addictive with the Wii points and unlocking of reps and routines. The step aerobics are fun and more useful than the Fit's jogging in place while exploring the virtual island.But, the hula hoop with multiple hoops are a super workout. Finally, the Wii Fit's games to aid in balance are fun and sometimes pretty hard, rolling marbles into platform holes, tightrope walking, soccer heading and more unlockables.The Fit evaluates your Body Mass Index, weight and balance, keeps track of your progress and more. One downside, is while aiding you in tracking wt. and such, if you are overweight (according to ht. and age norms) it will tell you where you need to be and the body shape of your Mii (or the character representing you) will be "subtlely" altered, but only in the opening BMI section, which you can skip. Also, the ladies (or gents) who want to keep their wt. a secret can put a password on their profile, too.Down the line their are more Fit tie-ins on the way, using the board for skating and Rayman's Rabbid's are on the way with one, as well. I recommend the charger, while the board doesn't drink batteries like the remotes, it is still a good idea. As is the skin to protect your board and yoga mat to protect you.
Luigi is delighted to discover he has won a mansion, but is not so enthused to find out it is overrun with  ghosts who have trapped Mario somewhere inside. But the nutty Professor E. Gadd has developed a machine for capturing these creatures, which he calls the Poltergust 3000. With the aid of the Poltergust, Luigi sets off in search of his brother.Inside the mansion Luigi meets the mischievous ghosts who kidnapped his older brother. The ghost's names are cleverly suited to their occupations (the pianist is named ''Melody Pianistonio'' and the artist is called ''Vincent Van Gore'').But while the game is quality, it is a bit light on quantity. Even so, LUIGI'S MANSION is a solid, enjoyable little adventure while it lasts.

I love Wii Fit Plus.  I just bought it yesterday at Walmart.  I have started with just Wii Fit alone, and had found that Nintendo had released this second disc.  This is by far the better of the two.When I first bought my Wii Fit, I used it to do the Body Test every morning.  I continue to do so, and religiously keep track of my weight progress on my wall calendar.  I enjoyed the convenience of the Wii Fit Channel, and have replaced it with the Wii Fit Plus Channel.  I have noticed that Nintendo has obviously made quite a few improvements upon the software.The Body Test experience with the Wii Fit Plus Channel is very similar to the original.  However, when you step on the balance board to be measured for your Center Of Balance and Body Mass Index, the software tells you to keep still.  The original Wii Fit software does not.I also find that some of the exercises on the original Wii Fit you have to unlock by doing others.  I've noticed that this is not true with Wii Fit Plus.  Most of the exercises on Wii Fit Plus start out unlocked, and are never locked.  This way you have a greater choice of exercise activities to choose from when working out with Wii Fit Plus, rather than with original Wii Fit.I am glad that I purchased this software.  It increases my motivation and use of Wii Fit.  If you purchase a copy, you perhaps can follow me down the path of fun and easygoing exercise and weight loss.
I discovered that I purchased my Wii Fit exactly a year ago today. Back on May 23, 2008 I weighed 298 pounds. A whole year later, I have slimmed down to 256.4 pounds. That's a total of 41.6 pounds of weight lost inside a years time.I love my Wii Fit very much, I do my daily Body Test every morning as soon as I roll out of bed.  Once I get my COB, my BMI, and my weight readings, I write my weight on the calendar.  I go through this process religiously each and every morning.If I can lose as much weight as I have with my Wii Fit, plus my will power, exercise, diet, and permanent health kick, you can do it too.  So what are you waiting for?  Purchase a Wii Fit and follow in my lead today.  Who knows, in one years time, you could lose more weight than me.

Hey! So I'm assuming that you are reading this because you what the game is but you are a little unsure on whether you want this game or not. RIGHT? If you have absolutely no idea what this game is about, don't waste your time here, go do some research first (google it!). The point of this is to help you decide, this is not a review that will tell you my opinion and let you learn more about this game. If you want to learn a little more about this game first, you should go read other reviews and come back to this. So, keep on reading if you know what this game is about and is UNSURE on whether to get this game or not.Let me guess, probably from seeing all these positive reviews right? I had the same experience too. All my friends got it and said it was amazing but I was still unsure about wether to get it or not. IF THIS IS YOU... then I'm going to help you a bit :) if not, don't waste time reading this. Go right read other reviews.OK. To help you decide, go through the little "flowchart" I've made. Start with #1, read it and answer yes or no. After you've done that, go the the next question corresponding to your answer. Let me help you with the first question, Do you enjoy shooting games? if your answer was no, you would go read #3 and then answer that question to go to the next and the next until you've reached a verdict.1) Do you enjoy shooting games? YES (go to #2) NO (go to #3)2) Are you good with the touch-screen on the 3DS? YES (go to #5) NO (go to #7)3) Is this game a present? YES (go to #13) NO (go to #4)4) Do you play your 3DS at home more than on the go? YES (go to #6) NO (go to #9)5) Do you play more than 30 min at a time? YES (go to #8) NO (go to #7)6) Are you interested in trying a shooting game? YES (go to #5) NO (go to #10)7) Do you get frustrated easily? YES (go to #10) NO (go to #4)8) Like playing with friends? YES (go to #11) NO (go to #12)9) Have steady hands? YES (go to #5) NO (go to #10)10) Tight on money? YES (go to C) NO (go to B)11) Have little or no games on your 3DS? YES (go to A) NO (go to B)12) Do you like collecting every items in a game? YES (go to #11) NO (go to #10)13) Is this person 10 or older? YES (go to A) NO (go to C)A) GET THIS GAME! WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR???B) YOU'LL LOVE THIS GAME. BUT NOT NOW. MAYBE LATER. Buy only if you get that "urge" of getting this game. If you don't know what I'm talking about... don't get this yet. I would recommend waiting for a price drop or a special deal.C) Nah, maybe you should think about it more. You might end up wasting your money on a game you're not going to enjoy. (I'm not saying you won't but you should do some more research before you decide)
This game was released in the early 90's, a time in which video game makers still focused more on fun gameplay rather than graphics and sound.  These days it seems more and more video game makers just want bragging rights for the best graphics and sound, therefore abandoning the most important aspect of the game; rushing out games that are clearly not finished and very little regard to actual gameplay.With that being said, at the time Zelda:Link to the past had very good graphics and sound to boot.  But what kept me playing this game over and over again was the fun gameplay!  I originally got this game when I got a replacement SNES and this game was bundled with it.  It took me over a year to play it, because I thought to myself, there is no way it could be better than the original Zelda on the NES.  One day I decided to pop this game in and realized that I was WRONG!  This was the most fun game I had ever played on the SNES even better than Super Metroid in many aspects.  It was very easy to pick up and play and easy to learn.  Once I started playing, I just could not stop.  It took all the aspects I loved from the original Zelda on the NES and multiplied them!This game was very succesful in capturing the nostagalistic feel of the original game while at the same time allowing me to enjoy a brand new one.  Absolutely fantastic.You still have to search for heart pieces, weapons, upgrades etc, but this game like the original makes it fun rather than tedious and boring.  I got a real sense of accomplishment when I found a new item and a even greater feeling when I finally beat the game.  This game was fun from start to finish and was never once bored, when I stopped playing this game after a long sitting, it was because I physically couldn't continue, not because I was bored or tired of playing the game.  In fact if I picked this game up today, I know that I will STILL enjoy it as much as I did back then!Its too bad that these days, I am finding myself rushing through a game just to finish it because other than the great graphics the gameplay is subpar and it gets boring after a while.  Rushing through a game causes one not to really appreciate the game and it tells me that the gameplay is lacking and the developers did not do enough to keep the player involved.Honestly, if I had to choose between a game with superior gameplay and OK graphics or a game with superior graphics and OK gameplay, I would choose the gameplay over the graphics everytime. While you get your occasional blockbuster on today's systems, for the most part the games are just all fluff and no substance!

This game is excellent any way you put it. I remember playing it for the first time about 12 or 13 years ago (yeah that IS a very long time), and I thought it was just the greatest thing ever. The graphics were supurb and even to this day they look beautiful. Though they don't stand up to ps2 graphics...it really doesn't matter with these old-skool games. I'm not a graphics kind of guy and never was, so it doesn't affect me, but if you are really into high tech graphics and haven't played this, i doubt you will like it. Don't get me wrong, some games with more high tech graphics are good, but this game (along with many others on SNES) proove that graphics don't make any game. But then again I don't play or own a playstation 2, so that's just how I see it. My views on videogames are rather conservative. If you are still under 16 and haven't played this game I doubt you will like it though, as it doesn't appeal to younger payers any more due to it's old school design that kids tend not to appreciate these days. But that doesn't mean kids won't like it. I just think people who have played it in the early 90s are mainly the ones who will enjoy it nowdays, unless you're a Zelda fanatic but haven't played this one yet, or if you like older games but haven't gotten around to getting this one yet. The music on this game is also very good, although the dungeon music can get very tedius and annoying, it's not that bad. The world music is classic, though and after you play it enough it will be ringing in your ears. Gameplay also doesn't get much better, you get a whole arsenal of items. Much more than any other Zelda yet. This game is basically the game that set the standards for all other adventure games, sometimes even RPGs. Another thing you might like about this game is that it is not way too time consuming, if you have a life to attend to you can do so while keeping up with the game as well. Even though I like really long games, this game is short in a good way. But the first time you play it , it will probably take more than 10 hours to beat, at least. If you get all the heart containers it will take even more. There isn't a lot of text in this game either, there's talking sequences but they usually end pretty quick...All in all this game is classic, and if you haven't played it-that's your mistake. Playing this game and hearing it's music after years really brings back those great childhood memories. Even to this day this game looks better to me than most new games. It just has that aura. I highly recommend this to any one into adventure games or RPGs that has a taste for the classics, or anyone who likes SNES or NES games.

You are Icarus and have been sent to the pits of Hades... What now??? You must work your way back from Hades to the Heavens to defeat Madusa! This is an original concept featuring great mythological enemies some nice gameplay, secrets and a big challenge. You are equiped with a bow and several other items you pick up along the way to destroy Harpies, Cenetaurs and other enemies. There are four worlds, each containing two or three levels then a huge labrynth to go through.

If anyone has played the first kirby game: Kirby's Adventures, for the NES, knowes what this game is like. No matter if you heard of it before or seen it beeing played, if you have played Kirby's Adventures, remember a little of it, and read this reveiw, you will know almost exactly what the game is mostly like. Ok, ok, I'll get to the point: It's a remake of Kirby's Adventures. Hm, a remake of an old game on GBA, oh so suprising ('Roll eyes sarcasticly'). It has the same levels and enemys and bosses and powers, but new graphics and mini-games. It's a new and imporved Kirby's Adventure on a conveinet, handheld electronic that fits in most overhead compartemts! Yeah (another sarcastic roll of the eyes)! But for those who havnt played Kirby's Adventures, this is a very inovative game, since no one's really made any cheap rip offs of the Kirby series yet. You play as a little cute pink ball that vicously sucks in and dijests enemys in a cute sort of way and takes their abilitys and uses the abilities against other enemies. Even after 18 years or so, It's still a unique gameplay, just because... no one has made any cheap rip offs of it... Any way, theres one pro, let me think, whats another, hmmm, Oh yeah, for those who played Kirby's Adventures, this brings back alot of nostalgia, and nostalgia feels good. And oh, yeah, the mini games are real fun and can be played with four other players. And with the unique gameplay, it's a good destroyer of bordom. Now for the cons. This game is very short, it can take one about half a day to play this game and beat it, there are lots of secrets to find, but like all games this becomes a chore to do after beating the game. Also, the game can be too cute for a large audience of people. And after one hit, you lose the abilty you ate from an enemy, and have to run back and eat it again. Theres a lot of running around eating lost abilitys, and since you can only have one at a time, this does become very repetative. For long-time gamers who played Kirby's Adventures, this is a great buy that really brings back the money. If you havnt played that first kirby game, its a good thing to get if you have a little money left over after buying other games. It's a good time waster and can cure most cases of bordom, but not extreme bordom.

Super Smash Bros. Melee, arguably the best overall game for the G.C.N.  This is my favorite video game out right now, and I can't see any visible flaws in it's design.  Gameplay is exactly the same as the prequel for the N64 (Super Smash Bros.) except you can perform more different moves. There are 29 playable stages including the place where you fight Master Hand, and there are 25 total characters (Starter and Hidden) including the original 12 from the Prequel, (such as mario, Link, Fox McCloud etc. and even 2 that America hasn't even heard of yet.  You also collect these things called trophies, where you can learn about your character.  There are 290 of them, (but I only have 287 of them).  You'll have to play for a long time to get them all.  There are also two modes of playClassic Mode- Where you fight your way to Master HandAdventure Mode- Where you fight your way to BowserOnce you access every character, you'll unlock the All-Star mode (You fight every character with almost no recovery so it's basically a survival mode). you start out with the following 14 characters...MarioPikachuC. FalconLinkFox McCloudSamus AranBowserPrincess PeachDonkey KongKirbyNessPrincess Zelda/ShiekIce ClimbersYoshiAnd 11 Hidden Characters that I won't spoil... (E-Mail me if you want to find out)This game doesn't have a basic premise, but it is great for anyone who is s-m-r-t enough to get a GameCube. so I Give Super Smash Bros. Melee for the G.C.N., a 12 0ut of 10.Nintendo For Life...(!Look Out for my Reviews on the following Games)1)StarFox Adventures: Dinosaur Planet2)Star Wars Rogue Squadron 2: Rogue Leader3)Bloody Roar: Primal Fury4)SSX Tricky5)Simpsons Road Rage6)Luigi's Mansion7)Super Mario Sunshine8)Godzilla: Destroy All Monsters Melee

Metroid Prime came out in late 2002 and shocked all compitition with its amazing graphics, emensis monsters, in a FPS with mostly a hunt and retreve mode.The game of the year for 2002 was taken place in an uncharted world named Tallon 4. Samus came to destroy half of the remaning Space Pirates from the original 2D game Metroid, she loses most of her abilities in an crash in a pirate frigate early in the game, she must collect all of her missing arsanal of weapon, suit, and visior ,over the course of the game, from the far corners of Tallon 4's climate(Tallon overworld, Phazon mines, Magoorn caverns, Chozo ruins, and Phindendra drifts), hunt the space pirates ,as well as their leader Ridly, and recover the sacred Chozo artifactes to get in the Phazon crater to see what made the Chozo bird-like people to go away and turned the animals into monsters.

Here is some data and some static and other information about this game from the mid 1990s area during the last years that supernintendo was in business before It was replace with the nintendo 64 for in between 1996 and  discontinue around 2002 maybe earlier. It's popularity was also short lived. You can beat this game with only 109 shoit is if you find and use the plasma a lot on the bosses the special weapon given to you by the metroid that was captured which ironcially scarfices its self to heal you restore your health if you make it to the final boss fight against mother brain.  Unfortunately ike at ridely the first time when he can't be defeated mother brained iniaties a self desctruct seqeunce upon here defeat you have about 3 minutes to get out of all the chamber  on to your ship and off the planet or your toast. The original metriod  in the mid 1980s was a big hit creating several sequels and prequels including metroid Prim I and Metroid Prim II. The first game is actuallu metroid prime for gamecube. Also  Samus depisite the characters brod shoulders look is actually a girl.  If you die in the game super metrioid her armor dissapeares and she appears naked for a few second then you must reloaded the game from the last save point used .Which this player on you tube that posted this run neglected to use thank good he always healed inbetween bose fights picked up enough spare energy packets to beat all the bosses except for the two sub bosses in about and hour the world speed recorded for this game. Also if you want to know Ridly, and Kraid where destroyed before  Super Metriod in Metriod II return of Samus for either gameboy or game gear Ridly, and Krad were also boss in that game also but were somehow were clone or recreated. In between this game and the prequel Metriod II return of Samus. Got to I hope this information was helpful and interesting.

Kawashima rightly recognises the presence of distractions in the modern world, and how gimmicks and gadgets promote multitasking, which in turn leads to reduced working memory and focus. This game is an excellent method of curbing these vices. If that wasn't enough, the Concentration Challenge allows players to see just how much this game has improved their focus. Devilish Pairs, Reading and Listening are my personal favourites.With eight Devilish Training exercises (which require five minutes of focus each), new and familiar brain and supplemental training exercises, this will keep children and adults occupied and entertained for weeks, if not months.
So quickly after their last brain-based hit, Brain Age: Train Your Brain in Minutes a Day!, Nintendo and NST have followed up with the colorful Big Brain Academy. The questions at hand are numerous: what's with all of these brain games? Is Big Brain as entertaining, addictive, and noticeably effective as Brain Age? Is it really worth another $20 to test the brain again?Big Brain Academy's focus drives away from simply the responsitivity and reactivity of the brain and also focuses on categories like memory, the ability to compute, analyze, and think quickly. There are numerous mini-games availible to test your brain's "size," and the trick here is to come out with the biggest, fattest brain possible.The mini-games in Big Brain Academy are favorable when compared to those in Brain Age. They're a little trickier. For example, one of them called "Coin-parison" asks you to compare two different amounts of coin and select which of the two is more valuable. Of course, you're expected to select one of the two amounts in a matter of seconds, so the game asks a lot of your mind and forces you to think extremely quickly for optimal results. Another example is the game "Flash Memory," where you're forced to very quickly memorize a sequence of numbers and symbols and then duplicate them with an on-screen calculator. I'd say that the learning curve is a little higher here than it was with Brain Age, but only slightly.I discovered that Big Brain Academy not only tests your brain, but also your eyesight. Games like "Flash Memory" and "Shadow Shift," which forces you to identify a character based on its shadow, really test how well you can see what is going on on-screen and interpret it.Big Brain Academy, for the most part, is accurate. After practicing with several of the mini-games, I took my first Big Brain Test and came out with excellent analyzation and memorization skills, but I lacked in computing and thinking quickly. This is pretty accurate to my real-life self, as well as my grade of a B-, which was my high school average.Visually, Big Brain Academy is a prettier, more colorful, and more engaging game than Brain Age. There still isn't much animation, and there is nothing exciting going on on-screen, but it all beats the Times font and gray backgrounds of Brain Age. The music and sound effects are quirky and sound a lot less like something that you'd expect from a brain game.Big Brain Academy is a much better game than Brain Age. There are more mini-games, each testing a specific area of mental activity. The addictive quality remains. The presentation isn't as serious, and looks and sounds much better. Really, the only thing that Big Brain Academy doesn't have when stacked against Brain Age is the abundance of sudoku puzzles. Still, Big Brain Academy is worth your $20, and testing your brain has never been as much fun.
This game would have market appeal to seniors or "pre seniors" who do a lot of sitting down or who lack stimulation. Apart from sudoku and crossword puzzles, Brain Age is a fun (initially) tester of your brain age using a host of tests. Then gets you to track your progress as you do your daily exercises. Rather fun and engaging - tests gauge your reflexes, memory, musical ability, comprehension plus plus.Recommend.
I am so happy that Nintendo came up with a game that I can play without me worrying about wasting time. In this game, you will go through a Daily Training. This Daily Training does help stimulate your brain so you are more focus, alert, and clear in your judgment. Math problems and reading are just a few parts of the Training. I personally like the Math challenges because I truly believe it works your memory like no other. I used to have problems articulating what I have in mind. Lately, I've noticed I don't stutter as much and people now find logic at to what I have to say. You need to purchase this game if you are in for a tenacious cognition. Having Brain Age will help you in getting all the knowledge you have stored in your brain to use! Remember that Brain Supplement FOCUS FACTOR? This is the safe alternative to that medication. BRAIN AGE IS THE ONLY BRAIN SUPPLEMENT YOU'LL EVER NEED.
Thinking. Analyzing. Solving Problems. Reading. Logic. These are just some of the skills that Brain Age will help you develop (or re-develop).No, it's not Resident Evil or Splinter Cell. But it is as fun and addictive; it's certainly as challenging if not more challenging, and it's a nice pallet cleanser from the plethora of pure entertainment value games that my kids and I play.Brain Age is a bit advanced at times for my grade schoolers, but the parts that they do get really help them develop the skills that they are concurrently working on in school. Big Brain Academy is a much easier (not better) alternative for younger children.There's a daily training area that gives your skills a workout. And there's a test area that challenges you to quickly and accurately work through various tasks, then provides you with a calculation of your Brain Age based on how well you did on the test. Sudoku has it's own area to train the brain on number logic.Kids reading this will NO vote me to death for saying this, but this is a great game for parents to get for their kids. It's one of the only ones (Big Brain Academy is the other) that I never take away from my own kids when they've misbehaved or simply just had too much video gaming. They never complain.One word of advice: Brain Age has a hard time recognizing an "8" if you write it the way you'd skate a figure 8; it likes it better when you draw an 8 as two circles on top of each other.Addictive fun. Buy it.

Paper Mario number 2 is nintendo's much needed RPG. The gamecube(or nintendo) hasen't had a good role player since the first 'slim n' trim' mario game, and this is flat out fantastic.The plot isen't to surprising, Princess Peach gets kidnapped agian for the upmost time, but at least not from Bowser, from an evil army of 'surfer-dude' sounding X-nauts. Bowser is a playable character in the game, but not really an important character. The plot is that ,besides Peach being kidnapped, Mario came to the Husler filled town of Roughsport, on Peach's will, to find seven crystal stars which open the Door, supposedly is filled with treasure(but is not). He travels from all the locations on his magical map which shows where the stars are. The X-nauts are hunting for them, as well as Bowser is, and you do incouter the 'nauts numerous times. In each place the stars are, their is a party member as well as a pathitic boss fight. During your diffrent chapters, you find many intresting things, as the mafia, wrestling arenas', and the moon, also the lottery & Luwigi who is on his own mission to find Princess Eclaire in a totally origonal adventure. You also get to use the diffrent functions of paper: boat, airplane, thin, and tube.Heres an extra, to obtian the mouse theif Ms. Mowz, look for an anonamus trouble at the trouble center. And last of all, at the end of the 100 trials pit is something very speacial, I won't say what, but here a hint, it's a very speacial badge.

The Wind Waker captures the saterday morining cartoon visual on a game. With all the bizzare weapons like the deku leaf and wind waker you solve surpisingly intresting puzzels as you hunt for you sister Ayrell.The Zelda makers used mostly recycled emeimes  and one of the origainal bad-boys Ganon(or Ganondorf). You venture across the sea in your talking boat, the red lion king, in miles upon miles of sea, finding outposts, islands and more outposts.Overal the game is one of the Player Choices, and I personaly think you will enjoy it(Please rate my other reviews).

Over the yrs, handheld ports of MK games have ranged from absolutely abysmal to merely embarrassing(AHEM...MK Advance), so DA deserves special mention for even displaying a level of competence. The sound is great with good vioce samples and surprisingly potent smacking sounds, and the tight conrols retain an impressive amount of 12 characters maoves, stances, and fatalities. And just like it's console bretheren, there's tons of stuff to unlock, even if it's mostly character palete swaps. The most unfortunate thing about GBA DA is the decision to ape the console version's 3D gameplay when it really wasn't neccessary,the arenas are blocky Mode-7 messes that do impossible Escher things whenever the floor meets the background, and the characters have been pixelated to make the "scale". 10 for ambition, at any rate, great game Capcom, keep up the good work.

This review is for Wii Sports Resort for the Nintendo Wii. This game is great, it is the second Wii Sports game released for the Wii. It contains 12 games- Swordplay, Wakeboarding, Frisbee, Archery, Basketball, Table Tennis, Golf, Bowling, Power Cruising, Canoeing, Cycling, and Air Sports. The game requires a Wii Remote Plus to play. My only complaint about the game is that it did not include Wii Boxing, from the first version of Wii Sports.-Swordplay lets you use your Wii Remote Plus as a sword to battle your friends or computer players.-Wakeboarding makes your Wii Remote Plus the handlebars of a wakeboard, and you get pulled around by a boat.-Archery is my personal favorite- using the Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk as a bow and arrow, you can target shoot for the most points.-Basketball lets you use the Wii Remote Plus to shoot baskets and play 3-on-3 basketball.-Table tennis makes your Wii Remote Plus a paddle, and you can play with a friend or computer player.-Golf uses your Wii Remote Plus as a club, and you can play a round of golf.-Bowling makes you use your Wii Remote Plus to bowl a game with your friends.-Power Cruising is similar to Wakeboarding, except you use the Wii Remote Plus to drive a jet ski on the water.-Canoeing lets you use the Wii Remote Plus as a canoe paddle to race on the water.-Cycling uses the Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk to pedal a bicycle.-Air Sports uses the Wii Remote Plus as an airplane, and you can fly around the in-game island.
U can do many things in this game.U can go fishing,catch insects,dig up things and many more.U get to talk to animals too.Almost everyday a new neighbor will move in.U also get to decorate ur house with furnitures and wallpapers.After a while,ur house will get bigger and bigger.But the bad thing is that u need to pay more mortgage.U can also mail and receive letters to or from ur neighbors.Sometimes,u can get presents from them too.It's very fun to play this game.Buy it!I'm telling ya,BUY IT!
A must have for anyone that owns Wii Animal Crossing.  Great sound quality, large audio range and extremely easy to install (Wii USB port). You must be able to connect to WiFi in order to use this.  It allows you to talk with friends and players from all over the world right from your living room with no need for a mic and headset.Besides Animal Crossing series, Wii Speak Channel will allow up to 4 different location users to connect with each other even without the Animal Crossing software. You are provided with a Wii Download Ticket with a unique number. The ticket, which can be redeemed via the Wii Shop Channel, will enable the user to download the Wii Speak Channel free of charge to a single Wii console. Via the Wii Speak Channel, you will be able to use your Mii and leave voice messages to your friends, share photos and have normal conversation just like if you were on the phone.I can't wait to see what other games Nintendo Wii will come up with to work with the Wii speak.
Well i bought the game for my GF mainly, but i must confess i started toplay it a little bit, only thing i don't like is that damn raccoon whoruns the general store! He's one greedy b*******!But over all its fun to play and your friends can visit you via-WiFi andrun a muck in your town planting (Pitfalls)all over the place!! or you cando town events like "Halloween" and collect [Bugs,Fossils,Fish,Paintings]or just furnish your home... if you can afford one.I found it funny you can mail neighbours, a present like "fruit" or "Junk"and they will be happy and sometimes mail you back a present (Random Items)usually fruit, i have all the trees planted in my town now.To sum it up: You can* Be a Boy or a Girl* Co-Op, via-WiFi* Use Text Chat* Visit the City* Buy a home & Furnish anyway you want* Upgrade you home -^ Larger, Largest, Second Floor, Basement* Plant Fruit Trees, and sell it got Bells (Cash) 500+* Collect hundreds of items for the local Museum* Meet different Animals, as they move in & out of town* Participate in Holidays* Buy Equipment* Change your characters Hair & ClothingI am sure there is more, but i will stop here thanks for reading.
I truely enjoy this game.  If you are a person that likes the games on places like Facebook such as farmville and farmtown i think you would like this game.  I have not used the wii speak part as no one i know has it yet. you are able to invite friends into your town and hang out with you if you are connected by the wii through the internet.  You plant, harvest, fish, pick up shells by the shore of the ocean, fill a museum with paintings, insects, fish, and dino fossles that you find in your town.  you can sell all thos things to earn money to pay off your house and make it bigger and buy things to fill the house.  special things happen on holidays and so much more.  I highly recommend it.

Before he was convicted of sexual assault, before he beat his wife half to death, and before he bit Evander Hollyfield's ear, Mike Tyson signed a deal with Nintendo to make a video game that pits a wiery-looking teenager nick-named Little Mac against (in order of appearance) Glass Joe, Von Kaiser, Piston Honda, Don Flaminco, The Hippo King, Great Tiger, Bald Bull, Piston Honda again, Soda Popinski, Don Flaminco again, Bald Bull again, Mr. Sandman, Super Macho Man, then eventually Mike Tyson. The bad news: You're not Mike Tyson, you're Little Mac. Fortunately, you have a chubby coach in your corner with a never-say-die attitude and a shiny pink bike (who says gay people have no place in video games?).So while the game isn't 2-players and you can't fight as Mike Tyson, it's still one of the best boxing video games you'll ever play.

Oh well where to start. well if you like to knock out boxers from all over the world up-close, using your trusty uppercut and low blows and star punches this for you. go up against boxers like Bald Bull, Piston Honda, Mr. sandman. Super Macho Man,Don Flamico King Hippo who by the way doesn't bother to get up at all after u knock him down the first time lol!i remember back when i was 10 in 1988 playing this with a friends. then i purchased Punch out in 1990 a cheap rip off this  game except for the last boxer who looks like mike tyson except he called mr. Dream. i think maker made that game Punch ou because mike tyson was in trouble with the law in the late 1980's or he had some kind of scandal going on. so they remade the game punch -out.when you finally reached Mike Tyson himself his puches will KO u in the first minute  and a half. then he will blink his eye and throw puches till he first round is over. you may have to and probably will go 3 rounds with him. once your score get past 5000 you can beat him by a split decison. so go on turn on mike tyson's punch out now an Ko him the hell out!peace ..fellow gamers and retro gamers..!!

I've played Rayman2 and loved so I just couldn't help getting the third installment.  Raymans adventure begins when a red lum scared to death by something turns into crazed blacklums, the blacklum multiplies until only blacklums are left in the core of the world.  After a couple of levels Globox swallows Andre, king of blacklums and those hoodlums won't give globox any peace until Andre comes out, meanwhile you as Rayman need to beat wacked-out levels to get to doctors and free globox of his pesky blacklum.  Thats all really, just one level I need to warn you about, the desert of Knaaren, those guys are creepy!  First they capture globox then they chase you, not to mention they're invinsible AND say weird stuff like &quot;brains&quot; and &quot;tastes better salted&quot;  they are the real meaning of depressing.  Now go buy it!!!!!

Some people were expecting this game to be a fantastic adventure with amazing battles and great action. As great as that sounds, that is not what makes this game fantastic.Story: The story takes place as Ike, son of the leader of the Greil Mercenaries is training with his father when he is finally offered to join the group. You go on a few missions, getting rid of pirates and bandits and such, when the mage Soren comes in from his travels and reports that the neighboring country of Daein as invaded your home country of Crimea. Rushing to Crimea's aid, you rescue a young girl from the wreckage who is discovered to be the unrevealed princess of Crimea, who nobody had ever heard about because of a royal bloodline dispute. Commander Greil decides to have the mercenaries escort the princess to the bordering country of Gallia (for a fee of course). Gallia is home to some Beast~Human creatures called Laguz. Commander Greil discovers one of his old proteges, the black knight, and gets slain by his sword, making Ike the new commander. Because of diplomatic problems, the king of Gallia could not offer sanctuary for the princess in Gallia, and pays for them to take a boat to the theocracy of Beignon to the east. After being attacked by Laguz of the crow and hawk tribe, the mercenaries arrive in Beignon to be greeted by their Empress, the Apostle. They aid the Apostle in covering up her guilt from a burning of a forest that was once home to peaceful Laguz of the Heron tribe. Ike and his forces then , with the help of Beignon troops, march north to Daien in order to Liberate Crimea from its hold.This game doesn't have terrific battle situations, mostly because most of the battle is in the strategy. I would give this game 5 stars because it is loads of fun, stretches the mind, and has an ingenious story line. I would strongly reccomend this game.
Rayman 3, Hoodlum Havoc is tops in all the catagories.  Wonderful music, beautiful color, fun bonus games, lots of locations.  The thing that really starts you out with a bang is Murphy, Rayman's sidekick and your personal, mouthy tutor.  He goes one on one with you with assorted, hilarious insults if you don't perform well during the tryouts.  My efforts were nothing short of pitiful.  His choice remark that just about made fall off the chair laughing was.  &quot;What's the matter with you.  Haven't you ever played a video game before?&quot;

This game is a tad hard for me, but my wife is addicted to it. Be careful because Dr. Mario prescribes a drug that some people become addicted to.

Most games based on Superheroes are bad and do not include all of the heroes moves. Spiderman has all the moves from super strength to spidersense and is an excellent game. You can not only play as Spiderman,playable characters include, scarlet spider , capt. univrse and much more.I found this game similar to the original Fighting Force on PSX. Spiderman sports nice graphic,sound ,play control, and is very fun. It is a must have for spidey fans, but even others may love it.Try it, it is a great game.

Calling all ham-hams!  Many of you players have played "Hamtaro 1:  Ham-Hams Unite!" when it first arrived on store shelves.  You may have thought that reuniting all the ham-hams in the first place was enough.  Think again!  An unexpected turn of events is about to take place when "Hamtaro 2:  Ham-Ham Heartbreak" appears on store shelves this April, only on GBA.The story behind "Hamtaro 2:  Ham-Ham Heartbreak":  After reuniting the ham-hams to have a Ham-Jam party in the first place, the demon hamster, known as Spat, spreads squabbles around all of the ham-hams, causing their souls, except 2, to become totally destroyed.  Now, there's no other way for the ham-hams to make up--the only way to get them back is with the help of Harmony, the angel hamster.  She's the only one who will give you important information on where the ham-hams were headed to and the boss enemies you'll have to fight against.  Once those objectives are fulfilled, you'll have to fight against Spat, who will be the final boss enemy in the title.  Good luck!How to play:  Your team is consisted of 2 ham-hams.  They're known as Hamtaro and Bijou, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Sometimes you have to use teamwork, and sometimes you'll have to split up to solve the puzzles throughout the game.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to find all the ham-hams while solving those hair-raising mysteries and dueling your enemies.  The title also contains new twists and turns around every corner.  Good luck, and grab this title while you can, because they're going fast.

This game was the direct sequel to Hamtaro: Ham-Ham's Unite. Instead of trying to round up the Ham-Ham's this time, your goal in this game is still very simple. A devil-ham (get it?) named Spat decides to destroy love and harmony around him with his mischievous nature. Hamtaro is chosen by the angel-ham Harmony to team up with Bijou (who he has to save first) in order to counter Spat's evil ways.Now the concept is very cute but in retrospect, it's kind of horrifying that the devil is trying to destroy love and friendship (sounds like My Little Pony Friendship is Magic season 2 episode 1 and 2.)Like Ham-Hams Unite, this game is challenging, even more so, but as a result, there are more things to do. The graphics in this game are way better than the GBC (and that was VERY good for its time). Fun Land has all the mini-gams and getting the highest score is always a plus. Rocks are used to make gemstones now (and that's how I learned about some gem stones in real life through this gem...I had no idea I was a turquoise).But in this game, you go from location to location to mend the broken bonds between characters...and again the game expects you to know who these characters are. Seriously, I had no idea who Pepper was when introduced in this game and years later, I'm still stumped when she shows up in the anime.But everyone knows the hardest stage in this game was Boo Manor. Unlike some people, I didn't get stuck here (but the Beethoven section in the game was what got me though because you had to know CLASSICAL music and the game was generous to throw hints around the area but if you weren't the type to look everywhere (and who would in the mansion full of creepiness as a kid?) you were screwed.Back to the characters though, this game does better with expanding on them and redeemed Stan to me given how instead of hitting on the chicks, he hangs out with his sister until Sandy and Maxwell hook up and then he goes. A caring brother here then in the last game. Some characters have been demoted from the original game like Panda and Jingle (does he even show up at all).Spat is the best villain ever. He's got a cool, catchy theme, he is pretty threatening (the thing he does at Sandy Beach is messed up. I mean, he pushed Barrette into the ocean and left her to DROWN and it's only a miracle that Seamore knew how to swim) and he BREAKS THE 4TH WALL. Plus, a lot of entertaining things end up happening to him in the game and it's hilarious. It's like Laharl from Disgaea going into another game and then you got Harmony who is Flonne trying to force the power of love on him with hilarious results.This game is way cheaper than the prequel so if you like cuteness and a challenge, get it (and that's if you're a Hamtaro fan).

The first time I played this game, I felt my mind grow.I play lots of video games, and you get certain mental paradigms engrained in your brain.  You judge games by how well they implemented their paradigm of choice.This game was ground breaking!It shattered my mental paradigms, and expanded my mind.I love it, and I even love replaying it.If you haven't seen a trailer of this game, it essentially is a gravity puzzler.  You run around from tiny planet to tiny planet, and gravity plays a huge role.  It isn't quite gravity as we know it (because the objects are usually fixed in place, so their gravity doesn't affect one another), but you are affected by their gravity (though you have to pretend each planet has an incredibly dense core for the gravity to make sense)....the one critique I have is that this is branded as a multi-player game.  It is not multi-player.  A 2nd player can join in to move a cursor around your screen to either collect stars, or just irritate you.  So it is definitely a single-player game, where a spectator can join in and perform 1 single simplistic task over and over.

Arguable the single most important videogame in history, SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, along with the Nintendo Entertainment System (hereafter referred to as the NES) singlehandedly resurrected the video game industry after the historic crash of 1983-1984.  Rather than reviewing the game itself, which has been done many times, I think many people may find the history how of this revolutionary title came to the videogame industry's rescue very interesting; I know I do.  I draw much of this information from various websites, one very good one in particular; unfortunately, I can't really plug them due to Amazon's policies.  Email me if you want the websites.By 1983, the gaming industry, in existence for a mere twelve years, had risen to an astonishing 3.2 billion dollar industry.  Atari spearheaded the industry, which introduced its first console in 1977 (Atari Video Computer System), and since had grown to hold two thirds of the entire market.  However, in 1984 all this would end with a thunderous crash.  This concise overview will show you the history of the home consol crash and how SUPER MARIO BROTHERS came to the rescue.In 1976, Warner Communications bought Atari for $28 million from the company's founder, Nolan Bushnell.  Over the next two years, Atari, suffering major production problems and Bushnell's bizarre management, lost Warner millions.  Bushnell and Warner's CEO fought, and in 1978 Bushnell was forced to leave.  Warner totally revamped the working style, and in 1979-1980, produced twelve new titles.  However, Atari was still dragging down Warner's stock.  Struggling to gain the market share, Atari made the smartest move they possible could have; in 1980, they began licensing arcade games, the first being SPACE INVADERS.  Over the next two years, Atari overtook the market, bringing in over half of Warner's overall profits.However, very significant problems would totally destroy the infant industry.  In 1981, Atari released PAC MAN on the VCS, and, because it was such a huge arcade hit, quickly became a bestseller.  Unfortunately, the quality was very low.  This was a major blow to the company's image, with fans and critics alike extremely disappointed.Another major stumble was one of video games' most infamous games, ET.  Warner bought the rights from Spielberg for twenty one million dollars. Atari, expecting the game to be as big a hit as the movie, which was the highest grossing film at that point, purportedly made more ET cartridges than there were consoles themselves.  ET proved to be a huge flop, nearly breaking Atari.By 1983, Atari was in serious trouble.  Suing Activision (which was disgruntled Atari employees who broke off and formed their own company) and Imagic, the two leading third party developers, Atari tried to gain control over its software catalogue.  Atari lost the suits.  Third party developers began popping up overnight, and the industry becomes saturated with very low-quality products.  (One of the most controversial is CUSTER'S REVENGE by Mystique, where the goal is to rape a Native American woman while avoiding being shot by arrows.)  The third-party developers went bankrupt; these cartridges were heavily discounted, and the major companies couldn't compete.  Another factor is the home computer market, that was just starting to come alive in 1984.  With an increasing amount of computer games and low prices, people started buying these over the consoles.All these factors lead to the crash of 1984.  In 1983 alone, Atari lost $356 million ($2 million daily).  Warner sold Atari to Jack Tramiel, former head of Commodore.  The video game industry died, with no major American corporation coming anywhere near it.  Enter Nintendo.A little history here will be highly illuminating as well.  What many people don't realise is Nintendo is a very old company, founded in 1889 (yes, you read that right) as a playing card company.  It became Japan's largest playing card company, and was very successful. In the 1960s, they moved away from the cards and got into the game and toy markets.  (A very interesting sidenote: during that same decade, Nintendo's president opened up a `special hotel' rented `by the hour.'  Supposedly, the married president was one of the hotel's top customers).  In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company scored significant points with big arcade hits and the Game and Watch product line.  In 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom (Family Computer).  It was a massive hit in Japan.  In 1983, Nintendo went to Atari because they wanted to release the Famicon to the American market.  Do to complications I won't go into, the deal fail through.  In 1984 they were looking to broaden their market share.1985, Nintendo announced the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System.  They release SUPER MARIO BROTHERS in Japan, scoring a huge hit.  In 1986, the NES comes full throttle into the American market, quickly becoming the biggest selling console ever, largely because of this title.  The NES owes much of its success to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS.  Coming prepacked with the console, there are an estimated 40 million copies of SMB in existence, making it the highest selling video game ever.Unparalleled, SMB blew open the doors to the videogaming world.  With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time.  SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire.  It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept.  Also, it's one of the best.  Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit.In the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment.  With a powerful new console and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming.  With its phenomenal success of the NES and this game, the video game industry once again took off, becoming one of the world's most significant economical contributors.And we very largely have this game to thank for it.

Over the next two years, Atari overtook the market, bringing in over half of Warner's overall profits.However, very significant problems would totally destroy the infant industry. In 1981, Atari released PAC MAN on the VCS, and, because it was such a huge arcade hit, quickly became a bestseller. Unfortunately, the quality was very low. This was a major blow to the company's image, with fans and critics alike extremely disappointed.Another major stumble was one of video games' most infamous games, ET. Warner bought the rights from Spielberg for twenty one million dollars. Atari, expecting the game to be as big a hit as the movie, which was the highest grossing film at that point, purportedly made more ET cartridges than there were consoles themselves. ET proved to be a huge flop, nearly breaking Atari.By 1983, Atari was in serious trouble. Suing Activision (which was disgruntled Atari employees who broke off and formed their own company) and Imagic, the two leading third party developers, Atari tried to gain control over its software catalogue. Atari lost the suits. Third party developers began popping up overnight, and the industry becomes saturated with very low-quality products. (One of the most controversial is CUSTER'S REVENGE by Mystique, where the goal is to rape a Native American woman while avoiding being shot by arrows.) The third-party developers went bankrupt; these cartridges were heavily discounted, and the major companies couldn't compete. Another factor is the home computer market, that was just starting to come alive in 1984. With an increasing amount of computer games and low prices, people started buying these over the consoles.All these factors lead to the crash of 1984. In 1983 alone, Atari lost $356 million ($2 million daily). Warner sold Atari to Jack Tramiel, former head of Commodore. The video game industry died, with no major American corporation coming anywhere near it. Enter Nintendo.A little history here will be highly illuminating as well. What many people don't realise is Nintendo is a very old company, founded in 1889 (yes, you read that right) as a playing card company. It became Japan's largest playing card company, and was very successful. In the 1960s, they moved away from the cards and got into the game and toy markets. (A very interesting sidenote: during that same decade, Nintendo's president opened up a `special hotel' rented `by the hour.' Supposedly, the married president was one of the hotel's top customers). In the 1970s and early 1980s, the company scored significant points with big arcade hits and the Game and Watch product line. In 1983, Nintendo released the Famicom (Family Computer). It was a massive hit in Japan. In 1983, Nintendo went to Atari because they wanted to release the Famicon to the American market. Do to complications I won't go into, the deal fail through. In 1984 they were looking to broaden their market share.1985, Nintendo announced the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System. They release SUPER MARIO BROTHERS in Japan, scoring a huge hit. In 1986, the NES comes full throttle into the American market, quickly becoming the biggest selling console ever, largely because of this title. The NES owes much of its success to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS. Coming prepacked with the console, there are an estimated 40 million copies of SMB in existence, making it the highest selling video game ever.Unparalleled, SMB blew open the doors to the videogaming world. With rich palettes of colour, eight four level worlds, spot-on play control, and expert level design, SMB was a much longer game than most of Atari's products and was a game unlike any other at that time. SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best. Without SMB, NES wouldn't have been nearly as big a hit.In the end, Nintendo came at the industry's key moment. With a powerful new console and a very well-designed game, Nintendo resurrected video gaming. With its phenomenal success of the NES and this game, the video game industry once again took off, becoming one of the world's most significant economical contributors.And we very largely have this game to thank for it
The game that singlehandedly saved the videogaming industryArguably the single most important videogame in history, SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, along with the Nintendo Entertainment System (hereafter referred to as the NES) singlehandedly resurrected the video game industry after the historic crash of 1983-1984. Rather than reviewing the game itself, which has been done many times, I think many people may find the history how of this revolutionary title came to the videogame industry's rescue very interesting; I know I do. I draw much of this information from various websites, one very good one in particular; unfortunately, I can't really plug them due to Amazon's policies. Email me if you want the websites.By 1983, the gaming industry, in existence for a mere twelve years, had risen to an astonishing 3.2 billion dollar industry. Atari spearheaded the industry, which introduced its first console in 1977 (Atari Video Computer System), and since had grown to hold two thirds of the entire market. However, in 1984 all this would end with a thunderous crash. This concise overview will show you the history of the home consol crash and how SUPER MARIO BROTHERS came to the rescue.In 1976, Warner Communications bought Atari for $28 million from the company's founder, Nolan Bushnell. Over the next two years, Atari, suffering major production problems and Bushnell's bizarre management, lost Warner millions. Bushnell and Warner's CEO fought, and in 1978 Bushnell was forced to leave. Warner totally revamped the working style, and in 1979-1980, produced twelve new titles. However, Atari was still dragging down Warner's stock. Struggling to gain the market share, Atari made the smartest move they possible could have; in 1980, they began licensing arcade games, the first being SPACE INVADERS.

A Note on Duck HuntThis review focuses more on "Super Mario Bros."  This particular version of the game is a dual game cart and includes Duck Hunt, where you hunt ducks with the Zapper Gun (awesome!) and if you miss too many times the b-st-rd dog will laugh at you for sucking so bad at a mere child's game.  Now, one thing to be aware of is due to the technology used, Duck Hunt DOES NOT WORK on new televisions such as HD TVs.  You'll need an old CRT television.  Overall a fun game but the type of title that now aways would be an Internet or phone title rather than a full blown main stream release.  How far we have come since the NES days!  This is the last you'll hear of Duck Hunt in this review.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Review Proper:Arguably the single most important videogame in history, SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, along with the Nintendo Entertainment System (hereafter referred to as the NES) singlehandedly resurrected the video game industry after the historic crash of 1983-1984.

Need at least 2 players but can play up to 4. Zelda: 4 swords. You can't play multiplayer without this.There is only one thing that can be confusing. There is a separate item that can play all the Gameboy Advance games on the GameCube. That is the Gameboy player accessory. It attaches to the bottom of the console and will allow you to play any Gameboy Advance game on the TV but you must use the Gameboy Advance as the controller.It will also work on the Nintendo Wii since it has the GameCube controller ports on the console.Here is a list of GameCube games that can utilize this Cable.All-Star Baseball 2004Amazing IslandAnimal CrossingBatman: Rise of Sin TzuBilly Hatcher and the Giant EggCrash Bandicoot: The Wrath of CortexCrash Nitro KartDakar 2Disney Sports FootballDisney Sports SoccerDisney's Magical Mirror Starring Mickey MouseFIFA Football 2004Final Fantasy Crystal ChroniclesFire Emblem: Path of RadianceHarry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsHarry Potter and the Prisoner of AzkabanHarry Potter: Quidditch World CupHarvest Moon: A Wonderful LifeHarvest Moon: Another Wonderful LifeHot Wheels Velocity XJames Bond 007: Everything or NothingKururin Squash!The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords AdventuresThe Legend of Zelda: The Wind WakerThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the KingMadden NFL 2003Madden NFL 2004Mario Golf: Toadstool TourMario Kart Double Dash!!

November is also the best month for gamecubeSo far Oct-Nov has come out with some pretty good games And I'm looking forward to the new GCN games to come out.  So far some pretty fantastic games have come out like Metroid Prime 2, Mario Tennis, Viewtiful Joe 2 and the Upcoming StarFox Assualt, Resident Evil 4(which the playable Demo shown at E3 04 is now avaiblable when preorderd the game) and Killer 7Though I must agree with one review who said that MP2 didn't get lots of advertising.  Nintendo stinks at advertising this game.  When Mp was heard it was getting some hype but 2 hasn't got any that much.  Hopefully Resident Evil4 and Killer 7 do.Well That's all I have to say and yup..November was the month of Killer Games...

Mickey's Speedway USA is a good game. Mickey's Speedway USA is hard as hell trying to win 1st Place. Even though, on some of the tracks, the curves is too sharp which it make the tracks more confusing. And I always keeping bumping into the walls and fall off the road into the waters for example like Hawaii and Oregon tracks. It take the skills and a lot of practice to get really good at the game. I think the best character to use is Dewey or Louie.

The Game Boy Advance SP is the latest new hardware from Nintendo. This portable gaming system has the exact same inside parts as the original GBA, it is simply redesigned to fit the GBA SP's more compact shape. This reincarnation of the Game Boy was developed to help Nintendo capture the audience of older gamers and also to better compete with the new cell phones that have games on them. The letters "SP" in the name stand for "special."The GBA SP is noticeably smaller than its predecessor. It is just over 3x3 inches wide, and about 1 inch thick. It is made up of two hinged panels, with the top part being the screen and the bottom part being the standard buttons (the design is similiar to a laptop computer--only smaller). The LCD screen part does not hinge or snap shut, but it is sturdy and does not shake or move when you are playing. The LCD screen is the same size as the original GBA's. The cartridge goes in on the bottom part of the front of the unit. The L and R buttons are still there, but smaller and are located on the back edge behind the other buttons.The GBA SP comes in the colors platinum and cobalt (metallic blue).The GBA SP is compatible with almost all existing Game Boy games (including GB Pocket, GB Color, GBA, etc.). Unfortunately, because of the way the game cartridge is inserted upside-down, tilt-sensor games, such as Kirby's Tilt-n-Tumble, will not function properly on the GBA SP. However, rumble games, such as Pokemon Pinball, do indeed work.Also, all existing accessories will work for this product, including the Card-e reader, the Gamecube link cable, and AC adapters. Instead of two AA batteries, the system uses its own built in lithium-ion battery which Nintendo claims will last 18 hours (10 hours with the light on).Yes, that's right! The GBA SP has a light on it, which may be the best reason to upgrade. The LCD part of the unit is lighted, allowing you to finally play in low or no light! The screen is lit evenly from all sides, making it look even better than a GBA with an Afterburner installed. The light turns on and off with a button above the controls.The specs are the same as the GBA, but in case you don't know them, here are the basic ones:-32-bit processor w/embedded memory-display approx. 41x61 mm-resolution 240x160 pixels-over 32,000 colors displayed simulaneouslyIn conclusion, I would highly recommend this product, especially if you do not own a Game Boy Advance. This product is targeted at new older-aged gamers, but even if you own a GBA, the [money] might not be a big price to pay for the cool new design, smaller size, and lighted screen.

This game boy comes with a built in lightwith a light switch,well thats good news,but The Game Boy Advance SP is a lott smaller then the standard Game Boy Advance and can fold up like a tinylaptop computer when not being played.And it doesnt use any standard batteries,the Game Boy Advance SP needs to charge like a regular cell phone with an AC adapter.A Lithium ion battery is built in and cannot be removed or replaced.Nintendo claims that with 3 hours of charging equals 10 hours of play or 18 if you dont use the light.but the AC adapter can be used as a regular power source so you can play the Game Boy  Advance SP can be played while plugged into the wall. The Game Boy Advance SP will have the standard D-pad ,A and B buttons plus START and SELECT.The L and R buttons are smaller and are placed behind the flip top screen.A new Front Light Screen (FLS) button has been added just under the display that functions as the off/on switch for the light.A new sliding volume switch is located on the right side. Games will be inserted from the bottum of the unit instead of from the top like the regular Game Boy Advance and the original. In addition the Game Boy Advance games,the Game Boy Advance SP will also support old and new Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.The games with the built in sensors like Kirby's Tilt'N'Tumble may not work  properly with this unit  because  the cartridge would be flipped upside down during play. The new Game Boy Advance SP screen is the same exact size as the regular Game Boy Advance screen. The Game Boy Advance SP will come with a AC adapter and headphone adapter. The headphone adapter will be required for any regular headphone set since the Game Boy Advance SP doesnt have a mini-plug input.In fact the headphone adapter uses the  same port as the AC adapter ,so using headphones while the unit is  plugged into the AC adapter would be impossible. Another concern is that Nintendo is still struggling  to come up with with a solution for consumers if their internal Lithium ion battery  dies from overuse. Three colors are offered in Japan:cobalt,platinum,and black.But in the U.S. only two colors are offered:cobalt and platinum.In the U.S. the Game Boy Advance SP will be available ... on March 23one day before the release of the game The Legend of Zelda:The Wind Waker for the Gamecube.THANK YOU FOR READING MY REVIEW ON THE GAME BOY ADVANCE SP..............

I purchased this accesory more out of curiosity than anything else; the price was not bad so I took the chance and I do not regret it.The GameBoy Player (GB Player) accesory is connected to the High Speed port below your GameCube console (GC), it has two tiny screws to tighten it to your console and avoid accidental drops.  An ejector button is also provided, to allow for proper removal.  A Startup disc is included and required to activate the GB Player.All features of a GameBoy Advance are included in the GameBoy Player (The Accessory Slot, the Game Pak Slot and the External Extension Connection).  You can play the thousands of Game Boy, GameBoy Color, and Advance games available as with your handheld Advance console.  You can also link other GB Advance units to the GB Player for multiplayer games using the External Extension Connector available, and you can normally use the e-Reader accesory as well.When you turn on the GameCube with the GB Player and a cartridge game inserted on the GB Player (not the GB Advance), you'll see the game's startup screen as you will normally do with your GB Advance console, this time the display is transferred to the larger TV screen and surrounded by a graphical frame.The games simply look wonderful, sharp and colorful.  All the details that you simply miss in the limited GB Advance display screen are shown here on the big TV screen.  I was expecting blocky, low-resolution graphics, but I was really surprised at the sharpness these Advance games have, even on larger screens.You can play with a GameCube controller or use the GB Advance as a controller (provided that you have a GC/GB Advance cable).  The Z button on the GC controller opens up the GB Player special options.Special Options include:- Frame Settings: There are 20 different and colorful frames to choose from- Screen Size - You can have Full Size screen or Normal Viewing (a larger frame borders your game)- Controller - This option tells the GB Player your button location preferences to take advantage of the additional buttons that the GC controller provides- Screen Filter - This option adjusts image quality- Timer - You can set a time reminder with a sound and a message on screen (&quot;Time's up kiddo, dinner's ready&quot;)- Change Game Pak - You are allowed to &quot;hot-swap&quot; your game paks, meaning that you do not need to turn off the power to switch games.This was a great addition to my gaming &quot;kingdom&quot;, I definitely recommend it.

(Taken from gamespot.com, under the name darksongbird)The characters are somewhat special and the music at its best is very good. Some battle music (and battles themselves) get very repetitive after a while with the same old same old, especially if you're in an area for too long. But it's an RPG. That might be a bit expected.The most priceless part about this game is probably the dialogue. It's amazing. I am currently watching The Mother Marathon (May 18th) and wish that they would just slow down a bit when it comes to some text so we can read it all.But I've played this game before so I already know some of it.What else? There are four main characters, Ness, your average, silent protagonist from Onett, the keen magician in training, Paula from Twoson, the great mechanic and Bottle Rocket Launcher (those things rock), Jeff from Winters and last but certainly not least, Poo the Prince from (Dallom?) in the far east, who eventually weilds some killer ninja star magic.Another huuuuge highlight in the game is its quirkiness. There are jokes here and there, some hideous characters (Piggy anyone?) and just all around weird things occurring all too often.I really can't say enough about it. But I think I'm in the minority when I say that when things get hard, they get hard. And playing through this game while interesting is a bit long and I don't think it has THAT much replay value. That's probably why the score isn't perfect like everyone else's.It's not without its faults, but this game from '95 is a gem if I ever knew one.Now if they'd only bring Mother 1 and Mother 3 to the U.S....Graphics: B-Sound: B-Story: B+Characters: B-Length: B-Overall: B-

Super Mario SunshineAfter Super Mario 64 set the bar for one of Mario&#8217;s greatest game in order to keep up with Sony&#8217;s Playstation Sega&#8217;s Sega Dreamcast a sequel to Super Mario 64 had been in the works for several years; the cancelled games Super Mario 64 2 and Super Mario128 were some ideas Nintendo had for a direct sequel Super Mario 64 2 was said to be developed on the Nintendo 64DD, but ended up being canceled. For those who don&#8217;t know The Nintendo 64DD was a disk system attachment for the N64 like the Sega CD for the Sega Genesis. The first games to be released for the new system would be SimCity 64, Mario Artist, Pok&eacute;mon(Pocket Monsters) and Mother 3. There were only very limited quantities of the 64DD were made available through stores. As a result, the 64DD was only supported by Nintendo for a short period of time and only ten games were released for it. Most 64DD games were either cancelled entirely, released as normal Nintendo 64 games as cartridge-based storage sizes had increased, or eventually ported to the next-generation Nintendo GameCube console.Super Mario Sunshine has some good things but with all that said let&#8217;s begin this reviewStory/Plot: Mario sets out for Isle Delfino for a vacation with Princess Peach, and her long-time steward Toadsworth. Upon a rough plane landing at the island's airstrip, they find that the once-pristine island has been polluted and plastered with graffiti. As a result of this pollution, sun-shaped objects called &#34;Shine Sprites&#34;, the island's sources of power, have disappeared, and the island is covered in a perpetual shadow. The culprit seen spreading the graffiti is disguised as Mario, who is named &#34;Shadow Mario&#34;. To help with cleaning the airstrip, Mario finds FLUDD, a powerful water cannon which is toted like a backpack and is also created by Professor E. Gadd. Mario is promptly arrested after the player defeats a slime-covered Piranha Plant at the airstrip which makes the hole in the runway disappear and recovers a Shine Sprite, falsely accused of vandalizing the island. He is put on trial, however it turns out to be a mere kangaroo court where the judge immediately finds Mario guilty and orders him to clean up the graffiti and recover the Shine Sprites. Until then, he is forbidden from leaving the island until he does so. The next day, Mario begins his adventure to find a way to clear his name and locate the real criminal, while restoring tranquility and order to Isle Delfino. After defeating another slime-covered Piranha Plant and rising a disappeared statue out of the ground, they see Shadow Mario on top of the statue for the first time who jumps off the statue, grabs Peach, and runs off with her. Mario chases him and takes him down and he creates a graffiti portal on the restored statue and escapes through it. Mario follows him through the portal that leads to Bianco Hills, one of the other areas of Isle Delfino where he defeats another slime-covered Piranha Plant and rises a disappeared cliff, some trees, and a section of a wall out of the ground and recovers another Shine Sprite. After defeating two more slime-covered Piranha Plants and restoring the disappeared boathouse and lighthouse that unlock portals from Delfino Plaza to two of Isle Delfino's other locations, Mario follows Shadow Mario, who has kidnapped Princess Peach, and has escaped on a Bowser-designed boat to Pinna Park, an amusement park located just off the coast of Isle Delfino's &#34;tail&#34;. There, Mario defeats a huge Bowser robot being controlled by Shadow Mario which is called Mecha Bowser by firing water rockets at it on the roller coaster. It is then revealed that Shadow Mario's real identity is Bowser Jr., the youngest son of Bowser. Bowser Jr having been told by Bowser that Peach is his mother. (Mario: Peach how could you? Peach: But I don&#8217;t even reme. Mario: no physically how could you?  )  Bowser Jr wields a magic brush that creates graffiti and is also created by E. Gadd. Bowser Jr turns the remains of Mecha Bowser into a hot air balloon and escapes again with Princess Peach. When learning the truth, Peach is visually upset for a second. He is last seen heading for Corona Mountain, a volcano where Bowser is holding a family vacation of his own. After Mario continues to clean Isle Delfino, retrieving Shine Sprites, and defeats Bowser Jr., still disguised as Shadow Mario, at least once in all of the areas of the island, a flood falls upon Delfino Plaza, opening up a cave that leads into Corona Mountain that Shadow Mario disappears into. Mario enters the volcano, defeats Bowser and Bowser Jr. by flipping over the hot tub they are in and rescues the Princess. Mario and the Princess fall from the sky with Bowser and Bowser Jr. While the others are plummeting down, Princess Peach floats down to safety using her parasol. Princess Peach lands on an island beside Delfino Plaza on her feet, but on the same island, Mario gets his head stuck in the sand, but gets out. However, FLUDD becomes damaged during the battle with Bowser, supposedly beyond repair. The Shine Gate's power is restored and the Toads repair FLUDD shortly afterward and Mario, Peach and the others resume their vacation, while Bowser admits to his son that Peach was not really his mother.Okay I have minor problems with this 1. When Bowser Jr was about to take Peach to Corona Mountain why she did just jump off when she had the chance. 2. Why was Mario arrested for a crime he didn&#8217;t commit? Lastly the benefits if you didn&#8217;t get 120 shine spritesIncomplete ending After the credits, if the player has collected less than all 120 shine sprites, a picture shows Il Piantissimo, a sprinter that Mario raced during the game, finding the brush that Bowser Jr. used to vandalize Isle Delfino.Completed ending however, if the player has collected all 120 shine sprites, a picture of the entire cast with the words &#34;Have a relaxing vacation&#34; is displayed instead.So we get a freaking post card. Not as impressive as getting the 120 power stars in Super mario 64.Gameplay: Players start off in the hub world of Isle Delfino and access various worlds via portals which become available as the game progresses. Like Super Mario 64 obtaining Stars, players obtain Shine Sprites by clearing various objectives given to Mario upon entering each stage, with more objectives unlocked in each level after clearing an existing one. There are also various hidden areas and challenges across Isle Delfino where more Shine Sprites can be obtained. Throughout the game, players may also find Blue Coins, which can be exchanged for more Shine Sprites. In this game, Mario is joined by a robotic backpack named FLUDD (Flash Liquidizing Ultra Dousing Device), which uses the power of water to clean away slime and help Mario reach new places. Mario starts with two default nozzles for FLUDD, Spray and Hover, which he can quickly switch between. The Spray nozzle lets Mario squirt a stream of water which he can use to clean slime, attack enemies, and activate certain mechanisms. Meanwhile, the Hover nozzle lets Mario hover in the air for a short period of time, allowing him to cross large gaps and spray things below him. As the game progresses, Mario unlocks two additional nozzles for FLUDD which can substituted with the Hover nozzle; the Rocket nozzle, which shoots Mario high up into the air; and the Turbo nozzle, which moves Mario at high speeds, allowing him to run across water and break into certain areas. Each of FLUDD's nozzles uses water from its reserves, which can be refilled via water sources such as rivers or fountains. There are also some areas where FLUDD is taken away from Mario, forcing him to rely on his natural platforming abilities. At certain points in the game, Mario may come across an egg which hatches into a Yoshi after being brought a fruit it asks for. Yoshi can be ridden upon and can attack by spitting juice, which can clear certain obstacles that water cannot, and use its tongue to eat enemies or other pieces of fruit which can change its color. Yoshi will disappear if it runs out of juice, which can be replenished by eating more fruit, or falls into deep water.Story 4.5/5 Gameplay 4.5/5 Music 5/5 Overall 9/10 = A-

I will always remember when I first learned that we got a SNES.  It was the summer of 1992.  Growing up in rural Oklahoma, my parents had a cow tank that we used for a swimming pool that we chlorinated.  I was in that tank all the time.  My father and my brother had gone to Oklahoma City (about an hour away from where we lived), and they had gotten an SNES, with "Super Mario World" prepackaged.  I immediately dried off, ran upstairs and my brother and I were immersed in Mario bliss.Being the Nintendo fans that we were, we were subscribers to Nintendo Power.  I poured over all the pre-cover of their latest [Nintendo] console, as well as any information we could glean of "Super Mario World".  I had even known some people who won the SNES in one of those give-aways they used to do back in the 1980s and 1990s on cereal boxes.  I was so jealous.Playing "Super Mario World" was a pure revelation that first time, and a perfect exhibition of the power of the SNES.  The graphics were gorgeous, the enemies were monstrous yet whimsical, and the Bullet Bills were enormous.There has always been a debate on which is better - "Super Mario Bros. 3" or "Super Mario World"..  For myself, I'd give the edge to "Super Mario World".  To be fair to "Super Mario Bros. 3", "Super Mario World" simply took the foundation laid by "SMB3" and perfected it, just like "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past" did with the original "Legend of Zelda".Essentially, take everything great from "Super Mario Bros." and "Super Mario Bros. 3", expand the graphics and audio from 8-Bit to 16-Bit, overhaul the level lengths and add a ridable dinosaur named Yoshi, include a lot of secrets, and wa-la!, "Super Mario World"!Everything "Super Mario Bros. 3" is so adored for, "Super Mario World" takes and does several steps better, with only one exception - suits.  "Super Mario Bros. 3" famously introduced us to Racoon Mario, Hammer Mario, Frog Mario, and Tanooki Mario (though oddly no Boomerang Mario, which we wouldn't see until "Super Mario 3D Land").  "Super Mario World" only features Fire Mario and Cape Mario.  However, Cape Mario is able to fly for unlimited amounts of time, unlike Racoon Mario which is captive to a P-Meter and can only fly for short bursts.The story, always the same in the core Mario series, is simply that, while Mario, Luigi, and the Princess are on vacation to Dinasaur Land after the events of "SMB3", Bowser and his seven children kidnap seven dinasaur eggs and also abduct Princess Peach.  It is up to Mario to free the Princess and rescue the dinasaurs.  Don't worry though, the story's not important.  Mario is never about the story, it's always about the gameplay.  And what gameplay it is!"Super Mario World" is famous for introducing the world to Yoshi, the ridable dragon.  Miyamoto wanted Mario to ride a dinosaur in the original 1985 "Super Mario Bros.", but was not able to implement this new character until this game.  It is strange Yoshi doesn't appear in "Super Mario Bros. 3"; after all, ridable steeds appeared in "Adventure Island II" and also the later game "Little Nemo: Dream Master". [Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshis - the basic green one, the blue one [(who, when swallowing any type of turtle shell]]Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshi, each with a special power according to their colour: green, red, blue, and yellow.  The green is the most common.  Upon injesting a turtle shell, the red blows fire, the blue flies, and the yellow creates a dust storm attack.  The green is able to do all of these, if he swallows the same color turtle shell (red = fire, blue = flying, yellow = dust).  The special color yoshis are only available in secrect Star levels, where they appear as babies which Mario must feed five enemies for them to become full grown.Yoshi is also famous for eating.  Strangely enough, Mario must punch Yoshi in the back of the head before Yoshi sticks out his tongue, looking for goodies.One of my favorite additions is just how Miyamota and company added to the lenght.  One legitimate weakness of "SMB3" is simply how short so many of the levels are - many times, you complete the level just when you feel you are about halfway done.  Even Miyamoto commented on this on one of the reissues of "Super Mario Bros. 3", asking his developers if the game's original levels were really that short.  Once a level is beaten, you cannot go back.  No so with "Super Mario World". Indeed, due to the secret exits and alternate paths, Nintendo encourages you to go back and explore levels already beaten, and the levels themselves are consistently much longer than those found in "SMB3".Taking the overworld map first introduced in "SMB3", for the first (and, until the 2012 "New Super Mario Bros. U", only) time on a home console Mario game, the map is connected and completely visible, unlike its predecessor.  Previously, the worlds were divided into individual maps, but not "Super Mario World".  From the get go, you could view the entire game map.  Dinasaur Land comprises seven different areas, played in this order: Yoshi's Island, guarded by Iggy Koopa; Donut Plains, guarded by Morton Koopa Jr., Vanilla Dome, guarded by Lemmy Koopa, Twin Bridges, guarded by Luwig von Koopa; the Forest of Illusion, guarded by Roy Koopa; Chocolate Island, guarded by Wendy O. Koopa; and the Valley of Bowser, home to not only Bowser but Larry Koopa as well.You cannot underestimate how the world map truly effected gameplay.  For the first time on a significant level, you could choose your own path.  The map also afforded the game developers the opportunity to made the game chock-full of secrets, alternate paths, and hidden areas.  The secrets were not so esoterically hidden to be inaccessible to the average player either - if a regular level had a secret exit, the level would be a red dot; if no secret exit existed, then the level is represented as a yellow dot.Each world is thematically diverse.  The first world features basic levels that ease the player into the gameplay, teaching you the rules and dynamics of Mario's new adventure.  The second world is set in the plains, the third world is set in caverns, and the fourth world is set on dual bridges, along with some mountain levels.By the fifth world, the Forest of Illusion, the challenge has been ramped up, and to proceed you MUST find those deviously hidden secret exits.  We then have the "tasty (but dangerous!)" Chocolate Island, which also features a level that how fast you beat individual sections determines what the next segment of that level will be.  Then we have the challenging Ghost Ship (which, according to the instruction manual, is a wrecked ship from "Super Mario Bros. 3"), and the only boss level that Yoshi will enter. After that, naturally, is the Valley of Bowser.One of the best features are the two secret worlds - the Star World and the Secret World.  Unlike other Mario games, there are no warp zones present in "Super Mario World". However, there are levels called the Star Road, which enable you to get to different parts of the map quickly and effectively by accessing the Star World and completing the levels.  To connect the Star Road, you must find the secret exits.  Once you find the fifth and final level on the Star Road, you are then taken to the Secret World, a world of eight gruelling, ultra-challenging levels that will truly test your Mario metal."Super Mario Bros. 4: Super Mario World" (the official Japanese title) is the best 2D Mario out there, though perhaps "New Super Mario Bros. U" will usurp this game from its lofty throne.Interestingly enough, Miyamoto has said that he was not entirely happy with "Super Mario World", as he felt the game had been rushed to publication and not completed to his exacting standards.  However, just like "Mega Man 3" (a game also apparently rushed), "Super Mario World" is as good as it gets.  I wonder what further changes Miyamoto would have made.  Unfortunately we'll never know.Those who love masterpieces of excellent 2D platforming action would be amiss without this purchase for their SNES - and better yet, "Super Mario World" is also available on the Wii and Wii U's Virtual Console.  Pick this one up!  You won't regret it...-----[This was written separate from the review back in May 2012 about the Mario games' development history.  Notably, Miyamoto said that "Super Mario World" began development with a team of sixteen people, and took about three years to make.  As "Super Mario World" came out in November 1990, that means Nintendo began production on this game sometime in 1987 - the same year they were working on "Super Mario Bros. 3".  On a game forum someone asked why Nintendo did not release "Super Mario Bros. 3" on the SNES, instead of the NES, and was complaining they should have released the game on the more powerful system.  This was my answer:]Let's look at some Mario history, shall we?  SMB3 came out in Japan in October 1988. That means it was completed, finished, and ready to be published by that point in time.If you look at the Japanese publication dates, SMB came out in 1985, Lost Levels came out in 1986, Doki Doki Panic came out in 1987, and SMB3 came out in late 1988. Given the fact the game was finished and released by 1988 I would hardly call that "late in the NES hardware cycle". Actually, the NES had only been out three years when SMB3 hit Japan, although the Famicom came out in late 1983. However all the heavy hitters for the Famicom came out in 1985 and beyond.Essentially all Nintendo had to do at this point was release it on cart; the code was written and completed. If have a sequel to the biggest game for your console, and the sequel SMB2 is also a massive hit - why wouldn't they release SMB3 which was already completed and published in Japan? They had a massive financial interest in getting this game out.There are very few differences between the Japanese SMB3 and the western SMB3 (namely if Mario gets hit with a powerup he goes to little Mario rather than Super Mario, ala Mario with a mushroom). There's nothing like the major differences between the Japanese and the Western versions of Zelda II The Adventure of Link.All four 8-bit NES titles were completed in a three year period, 1985-1988 (and were published in Japan as well, though SMB2, there called SMB USA, came out in 1992).I've read SMB3 took about two to three years to program, meaning Nintendo began work on it possibly by late 1985 (though that does sound entirely too early) but definitely by early 1987 and possibly even late 1986 given it was released in October 1988 and both Doki Doki and Lost Levels would have been finished (in the case of Doki Doki, it would have been closed to being completed if not already completed).In comparison today, that would be like saying Nintendo should not have released "New Super Mario Bros. Wii" back in 2009 (three years into the Wii lifecycle) because obviously the Wii U is coming up and they should save it for a new system. The timeframe is the same. And according to your logic, for this generation we definitely SHOULD NOT have gotten Skyward Sword for the Wii, despite the fact it has had a five year development timeframe was began shortly after Twilight Princess came out..I do find it strange that they had problems with Yoshi (which for the record Miyamoto has said he wanted to put in the original 1985 SMB). After all, Hudson's Adventure Island series, the same company responsible for the abomination that is Super Mario Bros. Special, the first ever sequel to the Mario franchise, were able to get ridable dinasaurs, and the 1993 Capcom title Little Nemo Dream Master had ridable creatures too.Then again, Adventure Island II came out in April 1991, two and a half years after SMB3.Basically, I said all that to say you should research your Mario history more. When Nintendo began development on SMB3 (late 1986/early 1987) the Super NES was nowhere on the horizon, at least not publically. Even in late 1988 when the game was published, we were still over two years away from the Super Famicom which came out in Japan in November of 1990.So that's why they didn't develop it for the Super Famicom.
I will always remember when I first learned that we got a SNES.  It was the summer of 1992.  Growing up in rural Oklahoma, my parents had a cow tank that we used for a swimming pool that we chlorinated.  I was in that tank all the time.  My father and my brother had gone to Oklahoma City (about an hour away from where we lived), and they had gotten an SNES, with "Super Mario World" prepackaged.  I immediately dried off, ran upstairs and my brother and I were immersed in Mario bliss.Being the Nintendo fans that we were, we were subscribers to Nintendo Power.  I poured over all the pre-cover of their latest [Nintendo] console, as well as any information we could glean of "Super Mario World".  I had even known some people who won the SNES in one of those give-aways they used to do back in the 1980s and 1990s on cereal boxes.  I was so jealous.Playing "Super Mario World" was a pure revelation that first time, and a perfect exhibition of the power of the SNES.  The graphics were gorgeous, the enemies were monstrous yet whimsical, and the Bullet Bills were enormous.There has always been a debate on which is better - "Super Mario Bros. 3" or "Super Mario World"..  For myself, I'd give the edge to "Super Mario World".  To be fair to "Super Mario Bros. 3", "Super Mario World" simply took the foundation laid by "SMB3" and perfected it, just like "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past" did with the original "Legend of Zelda".Essentially, take everything great from "Super Mario Bros." and "Super Mario Bros. 3", expand the graphics and audio from 8-Bit to 16-Bit, overhaul the level lengths and add a ridable dinosaur named Yoshi, include a lot of secrets, and wa-la!, "Super Mario World"!Everything "Super Mario Bros. 3" is so adored for, "Super Mario World" takes and does several steps better, with only one exception - suits.  "Super Mario Bros. 3" famously introduced us to Racoon Mario, Hammer Mario, Frog Mario, and Tanooki Mario (though oddly no Boomerang Mario, which we wouldn't see until "Super Mario 3D Land").  "Super Mario World" only features Fire Mario and Cape Mario.  However, Cape Mario is able to fly for unlimited amounts of time, unlike Racoon Mario which is captive to a P-Meter and can only fly for short bursts.The story, always the same in the core Mario series, is simply that, while Mario, Luigi, and the Princess are on vacation to Dinasaur Land after the events of "SMB3", Bowser and his seven children kidnap seven dinasaur eggs and also abduct Princess Peach.  It is up to Mario to free the Princess and rescue the dinasaurs.  Don't worry though, the story's not important.  Mario is never about the story, it's always about the gameplay.  And what gameplay it is!"Super Mario World" is famous for introducing the world to Yoshi, the ridable dragon.  Miyamoto wanted Mario to ride a dinosaur in the original 1985 "Super Mario Bros.", but was not able to implement this new character until this game.  It is strange Yoshi doesn't appear in "Super Mario Bros. 3"; after all, ridable steeds appeared in "Adventure Island II" and also the later game "Little Nemo: Dream Master". [Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshis - the basic green one, the blue one [(who, when swallowing any type of turtle shell]]Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshi, each with a special power according to their colour: green, red, blue, and yellow.  The green is the most common.  Upon injesting a turtle shell, the red blows fire, the blue flies, and the yellow creates a dust storm attack.  The green is able to do all of these, if he swallows the same color turtle shell (red = fire, blue = flying, yellow = dust).  The special color yoshis are only available in secrect Star levels, where they appear as babies which Mario must feed five enemies for them to become full grown.Yoshi is also famous for eating.  Strangely enough, Mario must punch Yoshi in the back of the head before Yoshi sticks out his tongue, looking for goodies.One of my favorite additions is just how Miyamota and company added to the lenght.  One legitimate weakness of "SMB3" is simply how short so many of the levels are - many times, you complete the level just when you feel you are about halfway done.  Even Miyamoto commented on this on one of the reissues of "Super Mario Bros. 3", asking his developers if the game's original levels were really that short.  Once a level is beaten, you cannot go back.  No so with "Super Mario World". Indeed, due to the secret exits and alternate paths, Nintendo encourages you to go back and explore levels already beaten, and the levels themselves are consistently much longer than those found in "SMB3".Taking the overworld map first introduced in "SMB3", for the first (and, until the 2012 "New Super Mario Bros. U", only) time on a home console Mario game, the map is connected and completely visible, unlike its predecessor.  Previously, the worlds were divided into individual maps, but not "Super Mario World".  From the get go, you could view the entire game map.  Dinasaur Land comprises seven different areas, played in this order: Yoshi's Island, guarded by Iggy Koopa; Donut Plains, guarded by Morton Koopa Jr., Vanilla Dome, guarded by Lemmy Koopa, Twin Bridges, guarded by Luwig von Koopa; the Forest of Illusion, guarded by Roy Koopa; Chocolate Island, guarded by Wendy O.

SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3, one of the most famous games Nintendo has ever produced, came out toward in the middle of the NES console's life cycle, and brought renewed life to the aging console.  Like the original Super Mario Brothers, SMB3 became one of the biggest selling games ever.  SMB3 also brought a lot of new innovations to the Mario series, many of which can still be found today.  SMB3 regularly charts both player and critic polls as being among the best video games ever released.Released [in at the end of 1988] October 3, 1988 in Japan, SMB3 became one the Famicon's biggest sellers.  America had to wait for over a year from when Japan got it.  Originally released in some Nintendo arcade machines before it even hit stores, the buzz soon spread about the game.  This buzz was helped by the ninety minute commercial known as THE WIZARD (some people insist that it is a movie proper, but it's little more than a Nintendo advertisement) in which the climax of the movie - er, commercial - is the unveiling of SMB3, as well as revealing the secret location to the one of the warp whistles.  America finally got its hands on the game in released February 12, 1990.The game went on to sell approx. eighteen million copies, and when you include the reissues and rereleases with SUPER MARIO ALL STARS and SUPER MARIO ADVANCED, this figure swells to over thirty three million copies.  And what makes SMB3 such a successful, highly regarded title?  Read on.For the second* officially released sequel to the biggest selling game of all time, Nintendo didn't pull any stops when it came to crafting this game.  Returning to the familiar environments and gameplay of the original title, rather than the radical reinvention of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, Nintendo greatly widened Mario's moves and gamestyle.  The Fire-flower and starman return.  Nintendo introduces Mario's famous raccoon suit, which enables Mario to fly briefly, and greatly opens up what is possible in level design.  New suits and powerups also include the Tanooki suit, which enables Mario to become a stone statue, a Frog suit for swimming, and Hammer Brothers suit, which enables Mario to shoot hammers.One of the biggest innovations was the inclusion of an overall game map, where Mario would move between levels.  Nintendo also used the concept (in a much different setting with a much different effect) in ZELDA II: THE ADVENTURE OF LINK, though in that title the overworld was much more important and you had a lot more freedom.  Here, the map served as a level grid in which to progress through the eight worlds.  SMB3 returns to the eight world format of the original game, rather than the seven world format of SMB2.The level design itself is where SMB3 truly shines.  First off, Nintendo returned to the original game for its basic game mechanics but [induing] ensuring Mario has a whole new bag of tricks to beat the nasty Bowser and his koopa kids.  While staying true to the overall atmosphere and play of the original title, Nintendo, over the course of eight worlds, features platforming levels that ingeniously use the game's new suits and powerups to fully integrate the player into the game's world.  Each of the eight levels is themed.  The first world is grass lands.  The second world is desert (much like the second and sixth world in SMB2).  The third is the water levels.  Where the castle is on the overworld map for World 3 is roughly a map of Japan and Tokyo.  The fourth world is the land of giants.  The fifth is the Skylands.  The sixth is frozen tundra, all ice.  The seventh is Pipeland, and the eight is Bowser's world, featuring lava, tricky airships, and challenging levels.SMB3 also introduces the seven children of King Kooper (whose the mother???), each of which rule one of the worlds and which at the end of each world you must fight in an airship.  Other innovations include minigames, new enemies (many of which would feature prominently in later titles), and the aforementioned suits.A good portion of NES games are notorious for being extremely difficult.  Some titles are damn near impossible (BATTLE TOADS, NINJA GAIDEN III), and others are filled with cheap shots and just unforgiving, unreasonable difficulty (the original MEGA MAN).  In fact, the original sequel to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS (known everywhere but Japan as THE LOST LEVELS) went unreleased in its original format stateside or in Europe for twenty one years due to difficulty and too similar to the original game.  We only just now got the title via the Virtual Console on the Wii.Fortunately, SMB3 has a very intuitive difficulty level.  As each world progresses, so does the difficulty of the levels, which culminates in the last world of Bowser, which does have some hard patches.  Overall, however, SMB3 has a medium range of difficulty, and while there are some tricky parts here and there, the game is not really that difficult and most players will be able to beat it given enough time.  Not giving too much away, SMB3 also jokingly refers to the original title after you beat Bowser, with the first words out of Princess Toadstool's mouth is "Thank you Mario, but our princess is in another castle . . . just kidding."  Strangely enough, they cut this joke in the SUPER MARIO ADVANCED reissue.Overall, SMB3 stands as one of the gaming industry's most outstanding achievements, and is one of the corner stones of the Mario Series.  As much as I love SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, SMB3 really felt like the true sequel to the original game, and Mario went out with a blaze of glory on the original NES with this title.  One of the greatest games ever.*Though this is the second sequel to be released and that the general public knew about, this was actually the fourth officially licensed sequel to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS.  The first, developed by Hudson Soft with Nintendo's permission, was a game called SUPER MARIO BROTHERS SPECIAL, which appeared on the obscure NEC PC-8801 in Japan only.  This is the truly forgotten Mario game, the real lost levels if you will.  Due to technical limitations, it does not scroll and the hit detection is rather off.  Nintendo had nothing to do with its development.  The second sequel is SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, released in 1986.  This title was released only in Japan.  The game was just like SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, but much harder.  Howard Lincoln of HOWARD AND NESTOR fame (anyone who had Nintendo Power back in the 1980s knows what I am talking about) hated the title, so they took a Japanese game called Doki Doki Panic, changed some sprites, and in 1988 released the American version of SUPER MARIO  BROTHERS 2.------------------.-----[This was written separate from the review back in May 2012 about the Mario games' development history.
