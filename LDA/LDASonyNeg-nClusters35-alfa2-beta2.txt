The Good:+Amazing production values+A fairly good story+An amazing soundtrackThe Bad:-Some very clunky controls-There are many moments where what you do as a player makes absolutely no difference.  Even sitting idly by and watching events results in the game simply pressing forward without the player suffering any consequences---NOTE: The Following Review is LengthyQuantic Dream is best known for producing the very well done Heavy Rain.  The storytelling and real sense of choice in the game made Heavy Rain stand out.  There was no such thing as a game over.  Even if characters perished or you didn't do something a certain way, the course of the game could change a lot.  Beyond Two Souls is the follow up and while I'd love to tell you it's as awesome as Heavy Rain, that's really only half true.  Everything about Beyond Two Souls production values really shines and stands out.  Gameplay wise, it doesn't quite hit as high, however.  There's nothing really &#34;Bad&#34; about Beyond Two Souls, but it's not the best follow up to Heavy Rain.Beyond Two Souls focuses on Jodie.  Ever since she was a girl she's always had a ghost like entity by her side named Aiden.  For the longest time it's hard to decipher just what Beyond Two Souls is about.  The story jumps between Jodie as a child, a teenager and an adult.  But it won't do so in any particular order.  The game jumps from one timeline to another quite often in a very non-linear fashion.  There are times when the story comes off as kind of a mess.  What'll keep you going, however, is how intriguing it all is and the desire to see it all come together.  And it very much does.  The only real strange part about the story being told in this non-linear fashion, is that there's hardly a reason to think it should be.  But even if it were told in order you might still be scratching your head for quite a ways into the game.  Mostly because we're introduced to new characters and plot elements that the story is content to turn its attention away from for extended periods of time before returning to them.  One moment we're with Jodie as a misunderstood teenager.  The next we're with Jodie as a scared child... and then an adult before going back to a part of her past.  Each one introducing something new.  Whether plot related or character related.As I said, it's hard to really say what the story is about.  It's really just about Jodie and Aiden.  Their relationship together and their bond. Everything from a production standpoint about Beyond Two Souls is really up there.  The acting from Ellen Page and Willem Defoe is really good.  Even most of the supporting cast is pretty good.  What might strike you as odd is the writing where there are some pretty poor lines every now and then.  And though the performances by most of the cast is good, there are still moments that stick out as rather bland.  Usually from lesser characters.On the upside, though, the game does look absolutely gorgeous.  The character models are amazing.  Beyond Two Souls is simply one of the best looking games on the PS3 right now.  From time to time the game might freeze up for a second or two or even slow down as a result, but the game is still really easy on the eyes.  But by far the best part has to be the games amazing soundtrack.  One of the best ever composed for a video game.  Simply put, Beyond Two Souls is an assault on the senses.  It's just a good looking, sounding and well crafted game.  Though the story can be confusing it's still good and filled to the brim with a lot of interesting moments and emotional highs.  There aren't many games like it on the market.  It's just a shame the gameplay doesn't stand out quite as much.The gameplay in Beyond Two Souls is most similar to Heavy Rain.  The key difference is that you'll control both Jodie and Aiden throughout the game.  When you control Jodie this is when it's most sensitive to Heavy Rain.  You'll wander through certain locales and perform task.  The game will usually prompt you to do something by pressing certain buttons.  Sometimes it's just a quick tap.  Other times you'll have to hold it.  Sometimes you'll have to hold more than one button at a time.  As you can imagine, sometimes the game will have you do some pretty mundane tasks.  For instance, when getting into conversations you're given choices such as whether to lie or tell the truth or stay silent, but these choices hardly really matter in the long run.  They certainly never really change the outcome of events or the characters reactions.There are also combat scenarios in the game as well.  Jodie will at one point train to fight.  You won't be doing a lot of it in Beyond Two Souls, but the mechanics are quite different from any other game.  When Jodie is performing an action in combat you will use the right analog stick to match some of them.  So if Jodie is punching off to the right, you must move the analog stick right.  If Jodie is kicking downward you must manipulate the analog stick downward.  The only problem with this mechanic is that it's sometimes hard to tell just what Jodie is doing.  It might look like she's punching to the right but it's really just a setup for her to hit someone downward, which means that instead of pressing right on the analog stick... you have to press down.  This actually happens A LOT more often than you'd think.  It doesn't matter, however, as the game is not particularly quick to punish you.Playing as Aiden is a different story.  When playing as Jodie, a quick tap of the triangle button will switch you to Aiden.  As Aiden you can phase through walls and manipulate objects.  You can possess some of your enemies and you can also heal Jodie's wounds or protect her from harm.  Aiden doesn't get quite the same combat experience as Jodie, but it's nice to be able to change from Jodie to Aiden.  Unfortunately you can't do this at all times.  The story pretty much dictates when you can and can't switch to Aiden.  It's not something that can just be done on the fly.There are a few minor complaints about the basic structure of Beyond Two Souls gameplay.  For one, the controls are a little clunky.  Even something so basic as walking can feel clunky.  Particularly when the camera angle changes.  It's easy to make Jodie walk into a wall or become disoriented.  Aiden doesn't control much better as it takes a moment to get a handle on his controls.Some of these problems can be softened if you simply download the Beyond Touch app for your smartphone or tablet.  Doing so allows you to sync your tablet or smart phone to the game and control it that way.  Though many a gamer will probably wonder why this is even an option when the controller itself works fine.  In particular, the app is especially helpful when controlling Aiden.  Along with this there is also a multiplayer feature in the game.  One player controls Jodie while the other controls Aiden.The only real downside to the gameplay in and of itself, is that Beyond Two Souls tries to do what Heavy Rain does in many regards in a story that doesn't quite allow for it.  Heavy Rain was big on making your choices matter.  Doing certain things and performing certain actions (or failing to perform them) resulted in some pretty serious consequences for the player.  The story never ended, but characters could die or events could really play out differently.  Beyond Two Souls tries this, but because of how the story is told it couldn't possibly hope for the same results.  In Beyond Two Souls your choices feel rather mundane in the long run.  They often don't mean anything.  When given choices the outcome rarely (if ever) changes based on one of them.  And if it does change, it never really impacts the overall story.This is compounded by how the story is told.  Obviously if you play through a moment with Jodie as an adult and it flashes back to her being a teenager you know that the end result of whatever it is you're doing isn't going to change.  The choices you make and the moments when you can make them are never impactful enough that they'll alter the story (despite David Cage often saying they would).  It's good at making you feel like your choices are important, but they never really make a difference in how moments of the story itself play out.  For instance, in one moment at a birthday party you're given the option to get even with the kids that bullied you there or just leave.  No matter which choice you make it doesn't impact the story.  It doesn't add to Jodie's character... or even help develop her.  It's great that the preceding scenes before it show that Jodie is different and an outcast... but giving us the choice between revenge or not never really plays a role in the game itself.  What you do here doesn't help develop or impact Jodie as an adult and it obviously can't impact Jodie as a child.  The game is full of moments like this.  Choices that are seemingly big but don't really impact the big picture as a whole.  This might be less bothersome if David Cage hadn't spent so much time telling us that they would.The greater sin is when this happens in gameplay.  David Cage, the games writer and director, has been quite fond of saying he's no fan of game over screens.  That the story must go on no matter what.  And in a game like Heavy Rain this is fine.  You're jumping between different characters in what is a pretty linear story.  But Beyond Two Souls isn't like that.  Since there's no such thing as a game over and the story must go on no matter what, the player feels few consequences for anything they do.  Because of how the story jumps around in the timeline there's not really much room for the game to really let you die.  Obviously if you played through a segment as an adult, you wouldn't be able to die as a teenager.  This doesn't stop you from getting in mortal danger where you'll have to make button presses to save yourself or have Aiden save you.  The problem is that because of the structure your success or failure simply doesn't matter.  In one moment I had to out run pursuers on a train.  One of the things that happens in this scene is that you can make Jodie jump over an obstacle in the way or not.  But it doesn't matter whether you jump over it or trip.  She still keeps going either way.  Tripping over it or jumping doesn't actually matter.  You must then fight them off.  Even if you miss every button press nothing really happens.  You'll get captured and have to escape your captive and jump off the train.  If you manage to fight them off?  You still jump from the train.  How you get to point B is different, sure, but the fact that it has absolutely no impact ON Point B itself is kind of strange.  Other times refusing to do a button input simply makes the game stop and all you do is watch Jodie struggle until you do what the game is actually asking you to do.  No consequences for inaction.  No incentive to hurry up (even in so called crucial moments).  You're given choices, but in a game that's so heavily ABOUT choices it's kind of strange that the impact of them isn't there.There are other moments that are a lot worse, however.  In some instances even missing every button press and just watching the scene changed absolutely nothing.  Some of them played out the same way.  In others the game just sits there waiting for your input.  But at no point in time did I ever feel as though making a mistake would ever result in consequences for me as a player.  What's the point of putting button inputs there if nothing changes?  It sort of makes the idea of Beyond Two Souls having difficulty settings laughable.  Needless to say, any player might as well jump right into the highest difficulty setting immediately.  More than that, it sometimes comes across like the game is putting this out there so that you can feel like you're playing a game without actually playing.  Certainly some scenes can feel a little different, but the story will always press on regardless.  And because of how its told there isn't really much room to put consequences on the player.  If you come to a moment where it seems like Jodie should die from your inaction or doing nothing?  The game simply makes you switch to Aiden to heal her.This is actually rather sad because Beyond Two Souls has some really intense moments.  Moments that, had the player felt more like a participant, might have come across as a lot more breath taking.  And believe me when I say... Beyond Two Souls has some really incredible moments.  Some that really hit emotional highs.  But it's hard to feel the impact when you realize that had you done nothing in them the end result wouldn't have changed.  Basically what I'm saying is... even in gameplay, Beyond Two Souls has a hard time making it feel like your choices matter.  I want to know that me NOT making a kick connect might result in some heavy consequences.  Again, in Heavy Rain this wasn't a problem because it felt like the choices you made mattered.  But the story and approach to that particular game allowed for that flexibility in the story telling.  Beyond Two Souls has no such flexibility.  It's not as though the game really has room to let Jodie die if there's still a moment on the timeline we're working up to.The story of Beyond Two Souls will have you engulfed and perplexed.  It's a good story.  One with a lot of emotional moments and a lot of effective moments.  In terms of reaching for emotional heights, Beyond Two Souls succeeds where few games really have before.  On the other hand, from a gameplay perspective Beyond Two Souls is no where near as exciting.  The player's actions making little difference in the outcome of events or the refusal to make players own up to their mistakes in gameplay is a little jarring at times.  It doesn't keep you from playing the game, but it does give off this idea that the player is merely a passive participant rather than an active one.It is definitely a game worth playing.  Even multiple times.  However, if you are a gamer that values the illusion of choice (or at least the feeling that the choices and mistakes you make in gameplay matter) then you have to get used to the fact that Beyond Two Souls will provide you with a lot of choices, but few that will make a difference or result in consequences for the player.  Beyond Two Souls is a good game, but had it had a couple of tweaks to its gameplay it would've been a great one.
What made ME1 so great was that it took a great RPG and put it on top of an average skilless shooter (Fire at enemies until you need to A. Reload or B. Recharge shields/health, repeat until enemies are dead.).  ME2 decides to go in the opposite direction and puts an average skilless shooter on top of an average - below average RPG and makes itself just that, average.Pros - 2 of the new characters introduced, EDI and Mordin, are both entertaining and are a welcome addition to the series.  Graphics still look nice but I don't really care about graphics that much and they don't affect the score I give games.  Still a big universe to explore and plenty of missions.  The MAKO is thankfully gone and you don't have to transverse giant worlds just to get to some secondary mission objective.  Plenty of background info on species and other such things.  That's really all I can think of.  Now the cons.Story/Primary Missions (No spoilers) - There's almost no story in this game which is really a slap to the player's face.  You find out who the Collectors are and why they are collecting people.  That's literally it.  80% of the Primary missions are spent either recruiting new characters or doing their loyalty missions, very few of which are interesting at all.  The final mission gives you some choices that can result in some of your characters possibly dying but unless you're slow, it's pretty easy to figure out who to use.  I had nobody die on my playthrough.  The final boss is laughably easy even on the harder settings.  I often found myself bored during the game because nothing interesting was happening.Secondary missions - Most of these are just boring.  In ME1 you had a lot of missions where you'd have to make either a good/bad/neutral choice to resolve a situation.  There's very few missions in this game that require that.  Some of these missions are pointless.  There's actually a mission where you go down to a planet, jog about 120 feet, press 3-4 buttons and the mission is done.  No choices, no enemies, nothing interesting.  There's actually a couple of them like this.  They got rid of the MAKO but then added some stupid new vehicle.  It doesn't control as poorly but its only weapon is an auto-homing missile and it has the weakest armor ever.  This thing takes about 4-5 bullets before it catches on fire and then blows up if another 1-2 hit it.  Anytime you are forced to use this thing, you just want it to end as soon as possible.Experience system - There is no experience gained from killing enemies in this game which was just a terrible idea.  There is now no reward for killing enemies other then they're not shooting at you.  All experience comes from completing primary or secondary missions.  Primary missions tend to offer 800-1000 exp for each one complete and you level up every time you hit 1000 exp.  Secondary missions usually offer 125 exp per each one complete though there are some minor ones that offer 40.  My main problem with this is that a lot of these missions are not equal.  You'll go down, destroy 25 enemies, collect some intelligence, maybe do some other stuff and then leave.  Other times you'll go down and do the 3 button mission I mentioned earlier and get the same exact amount of experience.  How the heck are these missions equal in value?  One where my life was in danger and enemies were killed is equal to pressing a couple buttons?  This makes no sense.  They just wanted a standard so they didn't actually have to work too deeply on figuring it all out.  You also get no health or anything from leveling, all you get is 2 skill points that you can toss into your characters now more limited skill tree.Inventory system - It's gone.  All they needed to do to fix it from ME1 was sort it by weapon/armor/misc and stack multiples but instead they just decided to get rid of it.  Now you eventually find 1-2 weapons for each weapon type that just have different effects then the other ones (better accuracy, slower fire rate, more damage but less ammo).  The problem is they don't even bother showing you the stats on any of them.  Some of them you can't even tell if you're doing more damage or what the heck the point of equipping it was.  Some are obvious such as pistols or the SMGs, but I couldn't tell what the difference was between shotguns or assault rifles.  Then throughout the game you find damage upgrades for 10% or something like that but once again you can't even really tell if it does anything because they don't bother showing you any stats.  Armor works the same way, you purchase something from the store and it all goes into one area where you can change it.  Most of them are nearly pointless as the suit you get from the DLC that came with the game is better until almost the end.  I didn't even bother changing out of it and it's not even really that good.Characters - The characters in ME1 were interesting, the characters in this one are mostly lemons.  The two best characters in this game are the two you get from the first one, Tali and Garrus.  Mordin and EDI were good additions but after that everyone else is meh to terrible.  Miranda could have been alright but I get tired of listening to her whine about how she was given good looks, intelligence and biotic powers.  Gee, what a terrible fate.  Jacob is alright but there's just nothing interesting about him.  Thane I liked at first but then he kept doing some stupid flashback memory thing and just became annoying.  Just die already.  Grunt is by far the worst character in the game and a terrible replacement for Wrex.  Samara likewise isn't really interesting, in fact, her code is kind of stupid considering she will murder innocent people just because it demands it.  Legion could have been interesting but then you realize he's just the Borg from star trek.  Finally there's Jack.  Yeah I get it, bad things happened to you as a child.  Here's an interesting concept, get over it and stop acting like a ..... to everyone.  You can stay down at the bottom of the ship for all I care.Gameplay - I see some people saying this plays better then the first but I just don't see it.  I found most of the changes to be annoying.  Your teammates have two settings, charge in and take cover while still leaving themselves exposed to 2-3 enemies or stand right next to an enemy and blast it out until one of them dies.  You constantly have to baby sit these freaks.  In ME1, my guys never really died unless there was an ambush or a boss/mini-boss.  In this game, they die constantly.  They also got rid of grenades for some reason which I hated.  It was nice every once in a while to toss one out and kill some clustered enemies or blow one up on someone who was coming towards you while you were re-charging your shields.  They are replaced by heavy weapons which aren't really that great.  I just stuck with the rocket launcher the whole game as I felt the others were pretty useless.  They also added ammo in this game for some reason which basically just replaces your weapon overheating from the first one.  I can't figure out why as you'll never run out of ammo.  You might run out in one gun but the pistol, assault rifle and SMG all work basically the same way and do the same damage.  As long as you have ammo in one of those, you'll be fine.  You'll never run out of ammo in all three.  Guns are now more accurate and only rely on your aiming.  This is really the only good improvement, although I didn't mind the way guns worked in the first one.They also made an annoying change to Shepherd as he can now get hit by an enemy rocket or something and then he stumbles around for like 3-5 seconds while you're getting blasted.  This lasts just long enough for him to get hit by another one so he can repeat his 3-5 second dance until you die.  They added a cover system which I just found frustrating.  Trying to run somewhere and accidentally touch a wall?  Well, now you're stuck to it out in the open while enemies blast you.  I often accidentally hopped over cover while trying to get behind it and often Shepherd would just stand up for some reason while I was behind cover.  Another thing is that they actually got rid of Shepherd's ability to sprint during battle.  Did he get fat or something?  I heard that one of the 6 classes you can play actually lets you do this if you put skill points in it but why should I need skill points just to run, that's retarded.  Especially considering you could sprint with every class in the first game, why can't I do it in this one?  Another annoying problem is that they didn't bother adding a run for outside of battle.  You can lightly jog but this is way to slow.  It takes forever to get around your ship or random towns.  How did they not fix this from the first one?Interface - In ME1 there was a nice interface where you could always see the health and shields of you and your teammates.  For some reason they completely got rid of this.  Now you can only see either your health or your shields.  This can be annoying if you got hurt and used an ability that automatically recharged your shields as they show you your shield status but now you can't see how much actual health you have left.  I have no idea what is going on with the teammates stuff.  They put their pictures down there at the bottom center and next to them is some kind of pie chart or something.  I don't have any idea what any of it means other then if it turns red they are taking damage and if they're faded out that they've died.  80% of the time I didn't even know they were dead until I watched them get back up from the ground after the battle.  What the heck was wrong with the original interface?  Why this nonsensical garbage that they put in this one?Galaxy map - Oh, where to begin.  You drive your ship around in this one between galaxies instead of just being able to select them.  This eats up fuel, which you get very little of but it's so cheap that you'll never not be able to buy more.  You just have to waste time driving back to the main hub of the galaxy to buy it.  This was just a stupid addition as were the probes.  You use probes now in some stupid mini-game to get resources from planets.  The problem is that you can only hold 30 of them and you'll use 8-12 per planet.  This means every 3 planets you visit, you'll have to drive back to the main galaxy hub to go buy more probes (which are also so cheap you'll never not be able to buy them) and fuel.  This gets old really fast.  Later on you get the ability to hold 60 probes but by that point you're probably done ever using anymore probes again.  I wouldn't have minded it so much if they just let me hold 10000 units of fuel and let me buy 500 probes but no, they had to be annoying stupid with this idea.Enemies - The enemies in this game are very boring.  You'll fight the same things over and over again.  This happens in most games but it's just very bothersome in this as they give you no exp or reward for killing them.  Almost every human/alien enemy works the same way.  In the first ME, the Krogans were actually tough and could mess you up real quick.  They turned them into a joke in this one, I don't know that they ever even hurt me.  The only real different enemies are the husks and the super annoying Scion.  The Scion throws shockwaves at you every 3-5 seconds and these will hit you even behind cover and do massive damage.  Your teammates will almost always die whenever you encounter one of these.  The worst part is that they don't even have to hit you to damage you.  I dodged out of the way of a shock wave while walking backwards, watched it pass about 10 feet in front of me and I still took a boatload of damage.  How can I get hurt by something that completely missed me?  They're not really hard, they're just annoying because of this and they have a crap ton of armor.  Then there's the main bad guy who randomly teleports into enemies bodies throughout the game.  An interesting idea at first but then he does it a million times.  All it really does is make that enemy really slow but much stronger.  He's not hard at all to kill and once he dies, if you don't kill the rest of the enemies fast enough, he'll just jump into another enemy to annoy you some more.Glitches - Expect and be ready for them.  I only encountered 2 that I can remember.  One was on a secondary mission where I just started floating in the air but could only walk about 3 feet in each direction and couldn't get back down so I had to reload my game.  Another was during a boss fight during Miranda's loyalty mission.  I guess I killed the boss too fast and because of that, some enemy who spawned behind the door I needed to go through couldn't get out.  Because there was still an enemy left I was still technically in battle during which you can't open any doors.  Thankfully I was able to randomly blast at the door and took half her life.  Then I couldn't hit her for another 3 minutes or so before I was finally able to kill her which ended battle so I could open the door and continue the game.Paragon/Renegade system - Not to much to complain about here, you really don't use them all that often to any interesting effect.  The game claims that going the renegade route makes your character seem like a bada.. but really all it does is make your character look like a giant douche.I'm sure there are other things but I was very disappointed because this game just wasn't good.  I was almost consistently bored throughout the whole ordeal.  I beat it just to finish it.  I couldn't believe the complete lack of story, the destruction of any sort of inventory system, the terrible experience system, the lame characters.  There's nothing really new or interesting other then maybe your side characters dying but I've played plenty of games where that's possible.  Some people loved this game, I just can't see why.  Didn't even bother doing a second playthrough.  This game isn't terrible, it's just not good.  This game was so bad that I'm not even going to bother playing the third one which is a shame because the first game was so good and had so much potential to turn into a great series.
UPDATE: 10/31/2013:Cory A. asked, "How does GT5 compare to other PS3 titles."Since Amazon banned my ability to make and replay to comment, but still allows my to write reviews, I have to respond here.*Try Motorstorm Apocolypse, Motorstorm Pacific Rift (no speedometer, no upgrading cars) is good.*Need for Speed Shift (enable damage in the Options menu) is really fun--a sim plus arcade combo.  Really fun and challenging along with the Precision driving points and Aggressive driving points and stars awarded for racing objectives completed during the race.*Dirt 2 is really fun off-line and on-line: really beautiful game and upbeat game.*Dirt 3 is good, BUT not beautiful and upbeat like Dirt 2.  It has different events, but is dull and lifeless compared to Dirt 2.*Shift 2 is pretty good (you can enable damage in the options menu).  The tires are a little skiddy, but you can go into the options and tune your car.GT5 is good, except for career mode where you are allowed to enter cars that far out-class the competition.GT5 is a beautiful game graphically, but the career mode is broken.  Race the on-line challenge events, on-line racing or Arcade Mode to get your money's worth.UPDATE: 08/27/2012I've since bought Forza 4 and have played it for about a week religiously. And I really can't play GT5 for more than 10 minutes.  GT5 is an arcade game with some simulation-type elements, but is far from being the best racing simulator.  Forza 4 (and Forza 3) are more realistic in every way shape and form. Forza 4 is the closest you can get to the real thing on a video game console. GT5 does not compare. After playing Forza 4, GT5 makes me retch and gag.  GT5 looks good, but is one of the worst racing games you can buy.If you're looking for good and fun racing game, you'll have much more fun buying one of the following as a first choice:Dirt 2Need For Speed Shift (the original)Forza 3 or Forza 4As a second choice:Shift 2 UnleashedRace ProDirt 3And as a last choice when no other options are available:GT5I won't go into too much depth, but I'll just give the major good and bad.The Good:+Arcade Mode+Career Mode only if you don't upgrade your car, or keep it upgraded to a minimum most of the time.+Special Events You must have an Internet access for these.+Track creator+Events and competions outside of Career Mode: karting events, rally events, and other events outside career mode+Weather, rain, snow, day and night driving and the ability to select from different tires (casual, sport racing, dirt, snow, hard, medium and soft).The Bad:*For a game that has a reputation as being the best or is supposed the be the best and bills itself as being "The Real Driving Simulator", it falls flat on its face.  It's not even in the same league as Forza 3.  And Forza 3 came out a long time before GT5.  Forza 4 no doubt stomps GT5 in the ground even harder.*Where's the damage?? There is none.  There is just a generic "thud" sound.  In Arcade Mode, you can enabld damage.  When enabled, it is very arcady in nature. According to other reviewers, you will get that unlocked after reaching level 19 or 29 (after you've played the game for about 25 hours).  I'm currently at level 20.*Long load times all throughout the game--before you start a race, when you retrieve a car from the big rig, playing on-line.  You can enable damage in Arcade Mode. It's okay, but not the best.  There is just a generic thud for any all all bumps you get.*In career mode, GT5 allows you to enter cars that aren't competitive to enter races--cars whose Performance Points and/or Horse Power are way out of the league with other cars or is way under-powered in the PP and HP to enter the competition.  You can have cars that are either 100 to 300 or more PP and/or HP superior or inferior to the competition.  You can just fall asleep at the wheel and win if you've got the superior car.  You aren't the least bit competitive if you have the inferior car.For example, If you have a car that's qualified to enter an event--and that car is halfway fully upgraded, or fully upgraded, you will be at least 1/4 mile ahead of the #2 guy in just 3 minutes and stay so far out in front of the 2nd place guy for the entire race. You'll start out in about 7th place.  Within 2 minutes, you'll be in first place. Another minute later, you'll be about 1/4 mile in front of the guy in 2nd place.  And this is with all the assists turned off. Or if you can enter a car whose HP and/or PP are 100 or more below the rest of the competition--you will have no chance of winning.  You be battling just to stay out of last place or be in last place with the guy in 1st place a mile ahead of you.  In Arcade Mode, the cars are all competitive, regardless of the car you've chosen.Another example: If the car requires a British car, German car, or only allows only one specific model of car, and you upgrade that car, you will be allowed to race even though your cars is 100 PP and/or HP or more than every one else.  Within a minute or two you go from 7th to 1st and then win by a mile.*If your car is over-upgraded you would like to enter a competition that your vehicle would be allowed to enter otherwise, you aren't allowed to remove upgrades. For example, I wanted to enter a special event whose only requirements were Soft tires, FR, and &lt;500 PP.  My car met the requirements, but was over upgraded and was at 517PP.  I tried to remove the upgrades, but couldn't.  If I wanted to enter that competition, I would have to buy a new car.*Falls way short of Forza 3 (and I assume Forza 4) in so many ways for the enjoyment of the gamer.  I have to mention this because this game bills itself as "The Real Racing Simulator" and there is the fallacy that GT5 is the best (but is not). So just for the sake of comprison, I'll touch upon the major comparative differences:*Career Mode in Forza vs. GT5, there is no comparison.  Forza wins.  GT5 is a non-competitor here.  Forza is in a league all by itself with the number of events, competitions, vehicle tuning, upgrading your car, removing upgrades, ect.  You always have a car for the event you are entering in Forza.  When you complete a race, you usually get a new car and you are immediately taken to the next event on the calendar. You have three different racing choices for each event.*Overqualified on under qualified vehicles--Forza ensures the cars are all on same level.  You aren't allowed to race a car that's in another league--or better or worse--to enter the competition.  All races in Forza are competitive, unlike GT5 as I've mentioned above.*Forza immediately tells you if your car is not qualified, but would be if upgraded, or would be if some upgrades removed--or if you have the wrong car--Forza will immediately display all the cars you own that are qualified to enter.  After just a couple hours of gameplay, you'll always have more than enough cars in Forza, unlike GT5.  If desired, Forza will immediately install or remove upgrades to make your car eligible in just a second, if needed.*Forza allows you to select the racing skill of your opponents from 4 different levels (in Free Play and from the Events list).  GT5 only has this ability in Arcade Mode (beginner, intermediate and advanced).*Difficulty Customization, Forza in unparalleled:  GT5 doesn't reward you for disabling assists.  Forza gives you more XP or credits when you race with fewer assist.  The less assists you race with, the more you are rewarded in Forza.  In Forza, there are the about 6 different presets, but you can customize each setting too.  The number of assists, and the degree of assist (the degrees in between no assist and full assisted) in unparalleled.*Vehicle setup/tuning:  again Forza is unparalleled in the amount of tuning department.  You can tune your car any  way you like, race, chose to race again, re-tune your car a different way before the race ect.  All aspects of your vehicle can be tuned to your liking (unless its an economy car like a Geo Metro, or the like which doesn't allow tuning).  Forza gives you a full description and its very user friendly.  In GT5, you can only tune a couple of parts and that's only after you bought the most expensive transmission or suspension and it's not user friendly  like Forza (or Dirt 2 and Dirt 3).  GT5 does have a nice graphic, but no help.*Telemetry.  Press down on the D-pad and you can schroll over to six different telemetry screens.*Forza is much more user frienly in every way, none of the hassels long load times like GT5, ect.You spend all your time in Forza having fun racing without all the sill chores and excessive load time and wasting your time in races where your vehicle is so far over or under powered.*Forza has its Event list in addition to its Career Mode / Season Mode.  There are so many different event and competitions to choose from.  It's unparalled by GT5, Shift 2 and many other racing games combined.*In GT5, the first 5 races are also so easy to win, they should just give you the victory.  You need to complete the races to get the credits so you can buy more cars to enter other events, so you'll just have to suffer wasting your time being 1/2 mile ahead of #2 without trying.*In GT5, at the start, you can only enter a couple of events. You need to keep buying new cars with your limited amount of money just to buy a car to enter an event if you weren't fortunate enough to have one delivered to you.  This means you'll have to re-race many events to get the credits.  As mentioned above, you'll have to drive around the track for three laps a mile ahead of the guy in 2nd place.*The maker of GT5 was so concerned with ensuring he got the graffiti on the track just perfect and other things that didn't matter, that he forgot about actual gameplay.  He obviously didn't play the competition and try to emulate it or surpass it.  So for a game that is supposed to be the "The real racing simulator" or "the best racing simulator" isn't.  Forza ripped the torch out of Gran Turismo's hand, won the race by over a mile and while GT5 is still stuck at the starting line in first gear.*Both Forza 3 and 4 and GT5 run at 60 FPS, contrary to what one self-deluded PS3 fanboy posted in response to another review.I owned Forza 3 for about a year, then I bought GT5 in around Nov. of 2010 and was disgusted by by unuser friendly it was and lack of damage.  I did like the Arcade Mode and the track creator.  There was only one Seasonal Event which had expired.  I got rid of GT5 after owning it for just a few months  I rebought GT5 XL edition because it was selling for $20 and had the $20 DLC code.  I haven't played Forza 4 yet.  But Forza 3 blews away GT5 in every way.  If Forza 4 is better than Forza 3, then Forza 4 blows away GT5 even more.Forza (3 and 4) and GT5 are two different game.  They are enough differences in them that they are far from being the same experience.  GT5 is more of a role playing game with lots of drudgery and tedious tasks mixed in.The only real similarities is that both try hard to have the cars look and sound real, in addition to the real tracks.Forza in unparalleled in Career Mode/Season Mode, the events list menu on Forza 3 is HUGE, and on-line play is much better in Forza on the 360 period.This game is good, but flawed in career mode.  The fact that you can enter an noncompetitive car in GT5 career mode really spoils  the career mode and you can uninstall upgrades to make it competitive.Again GT5 positives:+GT5 is a great arcade racer with damage element.  The graphics are great and shinny, but on a smaller scale than Forza 3 and 4.  The tracks, handling, damage are all more realistic in Forza.  The damage in GT5 is very arcady.+Good in career mode with a non-upgraded car, or minimally upgraded car most of the time.+Arcade Mode.  It seems like damage is enabled from the start too.+Track creator.+Seasonal Events.+Events and competions outside of Career Mode: karting events, rally events, and other events outside career mode+Weather, rain, snow, day and night driving and the ability to select from different tires (casual, sport racing, dirt, snow, hard, medium and soft).+When using the controller, remap the buttons in the options menu so the analog L2 is for the brake, the analog R2 is to accelerate, and the right stick is used to look left and look right.  When you enable the look left/right with the right stick its similar to looking left and right in Shift 2 and Driver: San Fransico as long as you press the stick slowly to the left and right.-Non-competitive cars allowed to compete in Career mode.  I'm going to go buy Forza 4 today so don't have to put up with GT5's BS and other shortcomings. I sold Forza 3 a few months ago, but haven't bought Forza 4 because I have too many games for my 360. I re-bought GT5 because of the XL edition, the $20 dollar price and the fact my PS3 collects dust too much.-no damage, until you reach a high level.  Damage can be enabled in Arcade Mode, but its more "digital" in nature.-load times-doesn't compare to Forza in any way shape or form in vehicle setup, difficulty, damage, graphical damage and percentage of damage from minor hits, accumulated damage, ect.  GT5's damage is arcady in nature.-not in the same league as Forza for Forza's vehicle setup, difficulty customization, user friendliness, load times, ability to select the racing skill of your competition, Career mode, events list, but that doesn't mean GT5 isn't a good game.-GT5 is a good game as an arcade racer and for all the positives it offers. The graphics are great, but on a smaller scale. Forza's graphics are larger the track you're driving on is realistic in nature.
WRPG or TPS:I bought this game believing that it was gonna be a wrpg, instead I was suprised to see that it had moved into the tps genre. That's not necessarily a good thing to do, switching genre's in the middle of the series. This game now enters into a different genre and suffering an identity crises being that its trying so hard to be both that it doesn't do either particularly well. I know that reviews are supposed to be based on the game itself and not what I was expecting, however, I'm reviewing this game based on the fact that it was marketed as an rpg with "some" tps elements in it not a tps with "some" rpg elements.*spoilers*Storyline: Main StoryThe main story starts out really good with the Normandy gettin blown up and Shepard dying. 2 years later Shepard is rebuilt by Cerberus and human colonies are dissapearing leaving no trace of what happened. Thats where the story dies and doesn't pick up until the end mission of the game. The game then focuses its story on getting more teammates and doing their personal background story missions. The main story takes a back seat to the supporting characters and there is no overall story advancement until you've done almost all of the personal story missions. In this game there is no feeling of a threat or danger from the collectors (the new enemy in the game) and noone outside of Cerberus seems to care about the human colonies going missing. The alliance doesn't even send an investigation team, they were so hellbent on Eden Prime when it was attacked in ME1 but now they're like eh, whatever. I was excited to get to go back to the Citadel only to find out that the council that is now in power because of the choices I made in the first game has no intention of meeting me and talking to me. Getting to be a spectre in the first one was a huge part of the story in the first game. I asked Anderson about getting spectre status back and he basically was like "here you go". Getting the spectre status back doesn't do anything, its unimportant and has no meaning and noone cares that I'm a spectre. The "twist" or oh wow part of the storyline isn't much of a twist being that it was used in a game early in the year 2009 called Gears of War 2-no, I'm not joking. Its way to similar to be a coincidence, its just plain sloppy and I can't believe noone else has seen or mentioned it with all the Gears of War references. Copying a storyline from another game is hardly Bioware's style and I was surprised that they did or used that in telling their story.Spaceports, level designs:The levels are pretty linear and small, they aren't massive and don't leave much or any room for exploration. I'm one of those people who like getting lost and trying to find my way around, so to me being told where to go and shown the way made it feel extremely linear. If I needed to leave the spaceport and had to go to a different system for a new mission, it was tabbed for what galaxy, system and planet to go to. The designs of the levels were actually done really well (Im no expert on describing level designs), they had animal interaction with the background environment and the levels had a great detail in the them but again they felt small and closed in not open and somewhat freeing. The develepors gave you a ton more galaxies to explore and very few were recognizable from the first game which really didn't quite make sense to me.  Even with all the new systems the game didn't have that feel of wanting to explore, going to a galaxy, selecting a planet to try and find an anomoly, it was tedius and what mission you did find felt like the same mission over and over again. Its also very easy to tell when you've explored a whole system because there is a percentage scale in the upper right hand corner telling you how much you've explored in that system and galaxy-gee, thanks for letting me know. One last thing to mention is every single planet is unknown until you explore it-are you kidding me?? The alliance and other alien races have civilizations on these planets, I'm flying around in the most advanced ship in the galaxy and they can't put the name of the planets in my galaxy map??? Its a small gripe but it goes to show just how little depth in these areas were taken into making this game.Loyalty quests:Your next of many quests and main focus of the game involve getting more teammates to join your crew, no convincing needed. After you've talked to them and learned more about them they will give you a loyalty quest. You get punished by not doing them, meaning you miss out on an extra power if you don't do the missions. Loyalty quests are a joke, they're very easy and they get repetitive real fast. By the time I got to my sixth, seventh loyalty mission I lost interest and care for the member and just wanted to get them over with. The best loyalty quest of them all, in my opinion,  is Grunt's, it's the most understandable one, it actually makes sense and the boss fight actually is a boss fight. Most of the character's missions are easy and if you're not paying attention you probably wouldn't even know you've entered into a boss fight until you were halfway done killing the boss. By the end of the game if you haven't done the loyalty quests you'll be wishing you had-they really make you regret it. You get Garrus and Tali back in the party from the first game, but why in the world do I need to make them loyal? They helped me save the galaxy in the last game so I'm pretty sure I've earned their loyalty already. I was also wondering how many squadmates do I friggin need!! I was fine with 6 in the first but now there's like 10-thats a lot of loyalty missions and a lot of talking and talking and talking. I like background stories as much as the next guy but seriously this is an overkill and a serious disctraction from the main story.Romancing squadmembers:Romancing squadmembers isn't all that great either, I had romanced Liara in the first game and when I met her in the this game, it showed the characters hug and kiss and then that was it. Well, they do talk but to me it didn't seem long and I felt gipped because I wasn't told much of anything (at least that's how it felt to me), no real detailed questions, no nothing-I was highly dissapointed in the interaction between the two characters. There is no girl/girl or guy/guy relationship, not that that bothers me that much, but if one I can do it in DragonAge and Jade Empire why not ME2.Customization: Weapons and ArmorThey took out the huge selection of different guns and armor. There are two different types of guns and 2 guns under each type for each character except for Shepard who gets to use 3 types of guns plus heavy weapons. To upgrade these weapons you need to tirelessly scan, scan and scan minerals from planets or buy the upgrades in shops-if you buy them they automatically upgrade and if you scan for minerals, you use the minerals to research upgrades for the weapons and again the upgrades are put in the guns for you. I liked being able to put the upgrades I wanted into my guns and armor as per ME1 instead of it being done for me. There are certain guns you find that are specific to certain characters but even they don't do the selection justice. So for example, Grunt gets a special Krogan shotgun and the explanation for why noone else can use it is because only the Krogan can handle that strong of a recoil. However, it also says the same thing for a specific Salarian weapon too-mistake me if I'm wrong but if a Salarian can weild it so can a Krogan. The overheating of guns is gone and replaced with ammo-I'm not even gonna touch that.I only found 4 different types of armor and wasn't able get each piece for each set. Armor was broken down into pieces, head, body, shoulders, legs and arms. Each part gives bonuses to sheilds and other stats but the difference is minimal at best, and the player can mix and match each armor to their liking. The Terminus armor seemed to be the best armor in the whole game, I actually noticed a difference in how much damage I could take. There is no way to check your stats so you can't compare or see what weaknesses you need to strengthen up. As for the Terminus and Dragonage armor you can't toggle the helmet on and off which made for a weird scene for when I met Tali for the first time in ME2. Tali recognized Shepard before Shepard said anything and she couldn't see Shepard's face because Shepard had the Terminus armor on-you can also apparently drink with your helmet on too. My biggest gripe in the whole armor thing is the only person who wears armor is Sheppard, no one else, the rest of your team wears their regular clothing into battle and if on a planet that requires you to wear a helmet they wear a mask. It really needs to be all or none. Once you do their loyalty quest you can change their costume (that makes an amazing total of 2 costumes for each teammate) and for Jack's, she actually gets to wear a shirt. I don't feel rewarded unlocking a different costume for my character that I have to make loyal and you can tell it wasn't a very important part to make in the game, it seemed liked it was rushed and that they really didn't care about the costumes or why Shepard has to wear armor but not the rest.Scanning minerals, buying fuel and probes:This is probably the worst part of the whole game. In the first game you clicked on a planet hit the "A" button and got your mineral for some planets. For others you had to drive the Mako in some crazy mountain that really sucked-if you want more info on the mako read other reviews, I'm not gonna beat it to death. In ME2 however, you actually scan the whole stupid planet and it takes for what feels like forever thats even with the upgrade-yes you can upgrade the scanner but it doesn't matter much when you're scanning planet after planet spending anywhere from just over 10 min's per planet (with upgrade) to around 15 minutes (w/o upgrade) per planet. I feel like I'm being punished, its time consuming, not fun and mind numbing. Also, when you do find minerals you shoot off probes to collect the minerals and you can get anywhere from 50-2,000 mineral deposits depending on how high the meter is on the scale. So you travel to different galaxies and systems to find minerals and you have to buy fuel and probes which gets expensive over time to get these minerals that you desperately need. Also, if you run out of fuel going to a different system you automatically get taken back to the system that has the fuel ship (I wanted to see if everyone would die out in space floating around with no fuel)-so basically there is no point to buying fuel except to waste your money.AI: enemy and alliesEnemy AI is pretty dumb, if out in the open they rarely took cover and even if I did get close they never tried to flank me. They pretty much knew exactly where I was on the map no matter if I was sneaking around or not. If they were near cover they would use it but still it really wasn't anything spectacular. One thing I did like about the enemies was that you could actually shoot their leg off or shoot the robots in half but I also think thats why the enemies all pretty much looked the same, there wasn't a whole lot of variety in enemy troops.Allies AI was really good (to me anyways as I played a sniper where I heard they are really annoying if you were up close in the middle of the fighting), they helped a lot in the fighting and took cover in pretty smart places, I played as a sniper so I never had a problem with them taking the spots I wanted or getting in my way while shooting. I never could tell if or when they were taking a lot of damage which really bugged me. The health meter from the first was replaced by pics of which teammates I had with me and the only time I knew what was going on is if the pic was in blk/wht, meaning they fell in battle, otherwise I had no idea what kind of damage they were taking. Something happened after I got my DLC though and my allies started abandoning me during gunfights, when the shooting started they ran off back to the beginning of the level and hitting the d-pad would bring them back to fire a couple shots and then they'd take off again. Lucky for me the fights didn't seem that difficult but it was still annoying getting in a fight and then all the sudden my allies had left me.Character Import:They did a horrible job with this and made a lot of people mad, especially me. Basically, if you played ME1 and beat it and your xbox got the red ring of death (like mine) and you ended up gettin a new one or having it replaced by Microsoft then you had to rebeat ME1 on the xbox you now currently have-luckily for me I kept my saves and only had to do the boss fight at the end of ME1 but others weren't so lucky. It took me over two hours after I had bought ME2 to play it because I had to figure out how to import my character. A lot of people either didn't have the first game anymore or didn't have a save anywhere close to the end of ME1. When ME2 starts up it takes the lvl of your character when you beat the game, so if you started a new game with your char and had it up to lvl 60 but didn't beat it on the second playthrough you didn't get that lvl character. Also you find out that it really doesn't matter anyways, depending on how high you get your character that level gives you a few bonus things but overall levels dont mean a thing in ME2. Also with a series of questions you can change the whole game of ME2 from your original if you wanted to. For example when I ended ME1 I picked "I don't care" for who should be Human council member between Udina and Anderson-"I don't care" isn't a choice in ME2 when getting asked the questions and I had to pick either Udina or Anderson to move on. So basically importing you're character has very little meaning on the storyline (some decisions like Rex can't be changed)when you can change it 30 minutes into the game. There is no point of going through this and why are they asking me these questions if I imported my character and choices in from the first game. I understand getting these questions if I had made a new character but not an imported one. Just another oversight in the developing of this game.Character levels and abilities:Leveling in this game is basically a joke-you don't see any stats, you don't see how leveling effects your character-what does leveling do?!!. I think you get to see how much health you have but thats it. The only point to leveling is getting points towards your abilities and abilities are far and few between. Your teammates have 5 abilities, chosen already for you,  and you get to put points towards them to make the abilities stronger and 2 of the abilities have to be unlocked by putting points in the other 2 abilities-it just doesn't make sense to me. The last one is unlocked by doing the loyalty missions for your teammates. As far as Shepard goes I think you get 7 but again you start out with 6 abilities,already chosen for you, and you just put points to the abilities you want and for the seventh one you actually get to choose but when you start the game over that ability is gone and you rechoose and get your points back. There is no strategy to this, you just put points in whichever skill, it really doesn't matter unless your lvl 10 or lower. The skills are on a 1-2-3-4 block scale, so you need one point for the first block in that skill, 2 points for the second block and so on. I read that people didn't make it to lvl 30 their first time through the game, don't worry its not possible-I did every single quest, side quest, sub-side quest and mission in the game. I made it to lvl 28. I know this because I listened in on every alien conversation I could, you get some side-quests for doing that, and went to every single planet (even searched the asteroid fields too, found some planets) in the galaxy trying to find missions. So don't worry if you didn't make it to lvl 30 your first time through, you didn't miss much and can't.Gameplay:If you've played Gears of War then you've already played ME2 in terms of being in firefights. Running around is just like in ME1 with a sprint button. Speaking of firefights, its really easy to tell when you're about to get into one. If you see a lot of boxes and places to duck and cover guess what???Difficulty:Normal and Hard are easy and insanity is either you have less health or their bullets do more damage, not sure which but insanity is only insane because of that.Downloadable Content (DLC): *spoilers*The dlc was ready from day one so why not just have it on the disc in the first place especially the "Normandy Crash" quest being that that is kind of a huge part of the storyline! I was excited to get to go back to the crash and when I walked into certain parts of the plane it showed what I thought was gonna be a flashback, instead it was pictures of the crew, no not only dead crew but crewmembers that were still alive. I walked into the cockpit area of the plane and it goes to showing a picture of Joker and not some really awesome flashback of watching Pressley getting blown up or Sheppard not making it to the escape pod. I was extremely dissapointed and very pissed off.Conclusion:Mass Effect 2 is mostly a TPS with very little RPG elements in it. If you like tps's you'll probably like this game, however, if like me and you were expecting a wrpg you'll be highly dissapointed. With the little to no control over customization and no (or should I say extremely limited) inventory it takes away from connecting or caring about your character and teammates. Since I felt that loyalty missions were an absolute must I had a hard time not getting annoyed with them and I was actually detatched from some of the characters I got late in the game. Leveling up usually means something in RPG's but in this game they are just numbers and thats it, I really couldn't tell the difference between level 1 and 20. Scanning planets, lack of difficulty, no suprise storyline typical of Bioware, unoriginal story advancement, loyalty missions feeling more like a must than an option and the lack of different abilities to choose from leave ME2 something to be missed. Loyalty and side missions are a joke-for example, getting ingredients for the cook is a joke and is unacceptable from Bioware as a quest. Mass Effect 2 is missing that Bioware touch that usually makes their games so special. I was expecting Bioware to deliver me that "WOW!!, that just blew my freaking mindhole!!" reaction for its twist moment and instead I got deja'vu remembering back to Gears of War's storyline. Mass Effect 2 is missing the quality and depth that Bioware usually puts into its games and thats why this game gets a very dissapointing 2 out of 5.
It would be perhaps too kind to simply label the development of EA SPORTS&#8217; basketball franchise &#8220;troubled,&#8221; as even that word doesn&#8217;t fully capture the issues faced by the company in their efforts to create a NBA video game since the release of NBA LIVE 10.  First up was a rebranding attempt with NBA Elite 11, which saw the release of a playable demo before being unceremoniously cancelled just weeks before its street date.  Development continued, but no game was even announced or scheduled carrying the proposed title of NBA LIVE 12 or NBA Elite 12.  Next up was NBA LIVE 13, a return to the franchise&#8217;s original name which similarly could not get onto store shelves.  In truth, that NBA LIVE 14 has even made it somewhere where gamers can purchase it for PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is an achievement in and of itself.Of course, just releasing a basketball video game isn&#8217;t good enough; with 2K Sports maintaining their NBA 2K franchise as their lone remaining sports title of significance, there is a large investment in the development of the game every year, which has helped it gain a loyal following.  As much as NBA LIVE 14 could not be expected to directly compete with NBA 2K14 on the PS4 and Xbox One this holiday season, it is inevitable that comparisons will be made between the two games, especially since they carry the same price tag.As somebody whose last retail NBA video game purchase came back on the Sega Dreamcast, and somebody whose fandom for the real-life NBA and the sport of basketball is limited at best, I nonetheless have tried both NBA titles on the PS4 for launch this year.  Since my experience and expertise with these games is limited, my impressions come from the perspective of somebody essentially starting out with no preconceptions about either game going into my time with them.Does NBA LIVE 14 do enough to justify a purchase this year?  Is there anything in this year&#8217;s game which suggests hope for the franchise in the future?  Read on for my thoughts on these questions, plus more!GameplayFrom the game&#8217;s hands-on debut at E3 2013, the primary gameplay selling point of NBA LIVE 14 focused on a feature known as &#8220;BounceTek,&#8221; meant to revolutionize the basic control scheme surrounding dribbling the ball in a NBA video game.  The control scheme utilizes inputs on the Right Analog Stick in conjunction with the shoulder buttons on the controller to string together various dribble moves to create space between the ball carrier and the defender, or to work past defenders.  There are also multiple &#8220;levels&#8221; of BounceTek moves available depending on how well each individual player can handle the ball, which is meant to separate the elite handlers from the mediocre ones.In theory, BounceTek is a great idea; in practice, it is quite convoluted and involves memorization and familiarity with very complex control inputs.  Even more frustrating for newcomers to the game (or basketball games in general) is the complete lack of a tutorial or practice venue, leaving players to engineer their own &#8220;test scenario&#8221; by starting a game and turning off all of the rules so they can experiment with how BounceTek works.  Considering that four years passed between EA SPORTS NBA releases, the omission of a tutorial or practice mode is quite galling, and difficult to understand; even longtime veterans of NBA LIVE come to this game needing guidance, and the lack of formal training hampers the ability for BounceTek to become second nature and easily applicable to the gameplay experience.Once you do gain some comfort with the BounceTek controls&#8212;or decide just to take your chances and spam the Right Analog Stick to see what happens&#8212;it is possible to have some cool dribble moves in NBA LIVE 14.  That said, the game&#8217;s basic controls&#8212;including simply moving players around&#8212;feel very inconsistent with regard to how much of a role momentum has on player movement.  Sometimes a directional change happens instantaneously, while other times a significant slowdown occurs first.  Not knowing how the game is going to react to your input adds another layer of difficulty to overcome in the early stages of playing the game.Shooting and passing controls are fairly straightforward, and the game utilizes icon passing through a shoulder button modifier to allow you to target a specific player.  On defense, players can easily put together steal attempts and block attempts, so most of the basic controls are easy enough to wrap your head around.Unfortunately, offense seems to be kind of a crapshoot at times; the ball has limited physics interactions with the rim on shots, so you&#8217;re likely to only see a handful of different outcomes on shot attempts, regardless of how many different kinds of shot attempts you&#8217;re taking.  The result is that, more often than not, you&#8217;re left wondering why a shot was missed when a subsequent attempt is made, since there&#8217;s not enough differentiation in how the ball reacts with the rim and backboard to understand why a miss occurred.Offensive rebounds can also be an exercise in frustration, again because the ball physics seem to have such limited potential outcomes on shot attempts.  Even on lower difficulty levels&#8212;I&#8217;ve been playing on &#8220;Pro&#8221; as I warm up to the game&#8212;defenders seem to box out the offensive rebounders too easily, leading to situations where offensive rebounds are a rarity, even if your team features great rebounders.There are also a number of basic AI errors which crop up during any given game of NBA LIVE 14; sometimes the AI will pass the ball to a player who has stepped out of bounds, making for an easy turnover.  Sometimes the AI players on the user&#8217;s team will run themselves out of bounds as they await a pass as well, with the same result.  AI players will sometimes completely forget about the shot clock and needlessly take a shot clock violation, and on some occasions the AI ball carrier has stood in place altogether until being charged with an eight second violation in the backcourt.NBA LIVE 14 allows you to run plays on offense, but using the directional pad to call a quick play only brings up the name of the play being run; there are no play diagrams on the court to explain what is happening or what your players should be doing to open up a favorable shot attempt.  This requires the user to again do significant research on the game&#8212;a game which lacks tutorials or practice avenues&#8212;in order to be aware of what their play calling means in the offensive end of the court.Despite all of these shortcomings in gameplay, there are fun elements to how NBA LIVE 14 plays.  It can be very rewarding to work into the paint and slam a dunk home or create the necessary space for a jumper after using BounceTek moves.  It can also be particularly rewarding to work low and then kick a pass out to behind the arch for a wide open three-point swish.  Defense can also be enjoyable, though the issues with player movement can wreak havoc on your ability to mark a player effectively.Also, despite NBA LIVE 14 being developed using the EA SPORTS IGNITE engine&#8212;an engine which has shown to be quite powerful in the hands of the FIFA 14 and Madden NFL 25 developers for PS4 and Xbox One&#8212;interactions between players are fairly hit-or-miss.  Sometimes players will interact with one another on contact in a believable manner, and sometimes it feels quite apparent that an animation has taken over any physics calculations and the game is playing out a pre-determined outcome.  Considering that the last version of NBA LIVE to see release is over four years old now, this is perhaps to be expected; however, given the competition, the game sits behind what players are expecting.As counter-intuitive as it may seem, it is possible to enjoy playing NBA LIVE 14; it just requires some &#8220;bargaining&#8221; on the part of the user to overlook some basic issues with the gameplay and AI as it stands on release, and this level of &#8220;bargaining&#8221; probably shouldn&#8217;t sit well with anybody buying into NBA LIVE 14 at full retail price.PresentationFor as incomplete a package as NBA LIVE 14 can feel at times, its presentation puts forth a surprisingly competent first effort using the ESPN broadcast license.  The scorebug and other overlays match up with what ESPN uses in real-life for games on their various networks, and the game makes use of studio announcer Jalen Rose and commentary team Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy lend an air of authenticity to the audio component.  Each game has a quick pre-game segment as well as halftime and postgame highlight shows which make use of the sidebar topic listings which will be familiar to anybody who has ever watched Sportscenter on ESPN.  Although the halftime and postgame highlights can be a little on the lengthy side&#8212;running up to four minutes if you don&#8217;t skip anything&#8212;that there is anything like this is presentation in the first attempt is admirable.For as much as the basic ESPN presentation works, however, the game seems to struggle with how to present highlights and other tracking within actual gameplay.  Relevant statistics can pop out from the scorebug in real-time to keep you updated on player milestones and trends, but the game is reticent to ever automatically trigger an instant replay&#8212;even on worthwhile plays on the court&#8212;instead opting to prompt the user to push in the Right Analog Stick after each completed play if they want to view a replay highlight.  Once you do this, the reason for the game&#8217;s hesitance to automatically trigger replays seems clear; replay camera angles stay far from the action and don&#8217;t really illustrate the up-close-and-personal feel of a real NBA broadcast, and some replays cause the frame rate to drop and stutter significantly as you watch it play out, without any obvious rationale as to why.As part of presentation, crowd sounds are a particular strength of NBA LIVE 14; even if the crowd models themselves pale in comparison to the more impressive crowds of FIFA 14 and Madden NFL 25.  Hearing specific touches like fans in Cleveland booing LeBron James every time he touches the ball as a visiting player provides a nice feel for the immersion, and a dynamic which hasn&#8217;t always been present in sports video games over the past few years.Multiple camera angles are available to play in NBA LIVE 14, though it should be noted that the default ESPN angle&#8212;an angle which appears to be broadcast-specific to each home court based on how that court is shot in real life&#8212;offers the best results in terms of frame rate.  Changing to any other camera angle can have a detrimental effect on the smoothness of the game experience, unfortunately.While there are some low points with regard to presentation, NBA LIVE 14 does an admirable job making use of the ESPN license in its first attempt; here&#8217;s hoping that the franchise gets at least another couple tries at making games so that the ESPN broadcast can become even more fully realized in the next few years to come.Graphics and PerformanceThere really isn&#8217;t a gentle way to say it; NBA LIVE 14 does not look like a next-generation video game.  It is not a graphical showcase for new owners of a PS4 and Xbox One, and in some ways its graphics would earn low marks even if it had been released for PS3 or Xbox 360.  Some players look closer to their real-life counterparts than others&#8212;particularly cover athlete Kyrie Irving of the Cleveland Cavaliers and other young players who were part of the marketing push&#8212;but even superstars like the aforementioned King James look quite different from how they appear in reality.The courts and stadiums themselves are fairly impressive with regards to lighting and reflections, but they are populated by those underwhelming player models and even more underwhelming crowd models, which is especially disappointing given the EA SPORTS IGNITE engine&#8217;s focus on creating &#8220;Living Worlds.&#8221;As previously stated, the frame rate stays solid at the default camera angles with few&#8212;if any&#8212;hiccups along the way.  Choosing to play the game using other camera angles, unfortunately, can have performance issues which make the game frustrating to take part in.Had NBA LIVE 14 instead been released on PS3 or Xbox 360 a few years ago, these graphics might have met less scrutiny and derision; unfortunately, as a next-gen launch title going up against the decidedly more next-gen graphics of its direct competitor, there just aren&#8217;t enough ways to say that the game&#8217;s visuals don&#8217;t live up to what gamers are expecting.FeaturesEven though gameplay and visuals have their issues in NBA LIVE 14, even the harshest critic can&#8217;t accuse the game of not offering a robust set of features through which to experience the game.The title boasts a Dynasty mode for users looking to choose their favorite team and play through entire seasons trying to lead them to multiple championships, and there are a fair amount of options involved here; for example, users can choose to start with current rosters, a fantasy draft of all NBA players, or redoing the 2013 draft heading into the initial season.  The user can also set the &#8220;Team Direction&#8221; for the team they control, which sets up different expectations had of the team and also affects the XP earned through meeting milestones over the course of the season.  Dynasty mode is more menu-driven than its competitor, but it still provides enough substance for anybody looking to get into that type of team career mode for NBA LIVE 14.There is also an individual career mode available through Rising Star mode, where users can create a player and take control of them through showcase events leading up to the NBA Draft and then take control of their career experience, earning XP for good performances along the way.  As with any sports game, each individual user&#8217;s mileage will vary with regard to a mode like Rising Star; early critiques of the mode include that it&#8217;s too easy to be penalized for your player&#8217;s performance in a game, as missed shots always see a negative evaluation even if a shot was taken in a good situation.The popular and profitable Ultimate Team mode shows itself in NBA LIVE 14 as well, allowing players to build up a team of superstars by buying card packs and assembling their roster.  For fans of this mode in other EA SPORTS titles, at the very least this gives them a different way to experience NBA LIVE than what was offered in previous installments of the franchise.Perhaps most exciting for me is the inclusion of multiple game modes which seek to connect players to the real-life season playing out in the NBA right now.  Live Season allows users to either play full games which have happened in real life through NBA Rewind&#8212;allowing users to jump into any night of the season and play the games based on the situations in place for the teams involved&#8212;or through Big Moments, which are similar to Madden NFL 25&#8217;s &#8220;Never Say Never Moments.&#8221;  Throughout the season, Big Moments will be added to reflect scenarios which took place in games across the league each night; in some cases, it might be controlling a single player and being tasked with scoring a set number of points in a set period of time.  In other cases, you might control an entire team and try to complete a certain percentage of three point attempts in a game.  These bite-sized gameplay experiences offer a nice change of pace from simply playing full games, and as the season plays out and games become more important with regard to playoff seeding, these modes will likely see more traffic.Also worth noting is persistent roster and ratings updates which happen basically every night for NBA LIVE 14 based on how the players and games turn out.  EA SPORTS partnered with Synergy Sports Technology to track over 70 ratings and tendencies for every player on the court in a given game to update the players and try to best replicate their real-life attributes in the virtual game.  Considering the lag time which can ensue in other sports video games with regards to roster updates, this is a bold move for NBA LIVE 14 which will hopefully pay dividends for people playing the game.OverallNBA LIVE 14 is a game which is simultaneously simple and difficult to evaluate; it is simple to point out the game&#8217;s numerous shortcomings and use those as justification for why the game is overpriced at its current MSRP, and why fans of the NBA would be better served at this time to purchase the competing NBA 2K14 title instead if they&#8217;ve upgraded to a PlayStation 4 or Xbox One already.  It is difficult to say that NBA LIVE 14 should be written off altogether, however, because it offers good ideas&#8212;BounceTek, ESPN presentation, Live Season, etc.&#8212;which just need the benefit of more development time and more experience on the next-gen consoles to fully develop.  As stated earlier in these impressions, it is possible to have fun playing NBA LIVE 14, as long as the game&#8217;s inherent issues are understood and taken in stride; obviously, not all users will be able to do so, especially if they drop $60 on the game expecting it to live up to the standards of the other sports video games available at launch for PS4 and Xbox One.It also must be said that NBA LIVE 14 is a game which could see significant post-release support in the weeks and months to come, per a letter to the gaming community from the development team suggesting that the game&#8217;s visuals&#8212;among other issues&#8212;could be addressed in order to improve the overall experience.  Obviously nothing concrete can be taken away from this statement until the developers are able to deliver on it, but it&#8217;s worth noting that the potential is there for the game to see changes down the road.A significant hurdle was cleared simply by NBA LIVE 14 seeing retail release and being available for consumers to purchase.  However, there is certainly no mandate that consumers should make the decision to do so blindly; PS4 and Xbox One owners should make it a point to try NBA LIVE 14 first, and purchase solely based on their hands-on experience if it&#8217;s deemed worthwhile.  In the meantime, the ball shifts back to the court of the development team at EA Tiburon, where hopefully enough work can be done to see NBA LIVE 14 develop into something greater, or to see a much stronger release in a potential NBA LIVE 15 next fall.Like its cover athlete, NBA LIVE 14 has potential; however, it remains to be seen how much of that potential can legitimately translate to greatness in the future, or if we&#8217;ll regard this attempt to reboot the franchise as a bust down the road.
