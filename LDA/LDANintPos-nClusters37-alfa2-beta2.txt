Excelente juego. Es muy diferente a cualquier juego de v&iacute;deo. Obliga a pensar y a moverse, dos cosas que en los v&iacute;deo juegos son muy escasas. los gr&aacute;ficos son simples, pero no se necesita mas. la m&uacute;sica es muy adictiva y divertida. Claro esta que uno no aguanta jugar por horas este juego, pero si lo anima a jugar un poco todos los d&iacute;as para seguir avanzando y eso es muy bueno con los ni&ntilde;os que normalmente se quedan pegados a un juego por horas.
Este no es el juego tradicional de mover el control. Este es el juego de mover el cerebro y luego mover el control. Muy sencillo, muy divertido y permite jugar en familia. Tiene muchas opciones y es muy divertido. Mis hijos y yo lo jugamos juntos todo el tiempo y me gusta por que no me aburre y no los aburre a ellos.
No he dejado de jugar todos los dias! felicidades al vendedor, los controles son excelentes y me gusta mucho el color

Excelente juego. Es muy diferente a cualquier juego de v&iacute;deo. Obliga a pensar y a moverse, dos cosas que en los v&iacute;deo juegos son muy escasas. los gr&aacute;ficos son simples, pero no se necesita mas. la m&uacute;sica es muy adictiva y divertida. Claro esta que uno no aguanta jugar por horas este juego, pero si lo anima a jugar un poco todos los d&iacute;as para seguir avanzando y eso es muy bueno con los ni&ntilde;os que normalmente se quedan pegados a un juego por horas.
Este no es el juego tradicional de mover el control. Este es el juego de mover el cerebro y luego mover el control. Muy sencillo, muy divertido y permite jugar en familia. Tiene muchas opciones y es muy divertido. Mis hijos y yo lo jugamos juntos todo el tiempo y me gusta por que no me aburre y no los aburre a ellos.
No he dejado de jugar todos los dias! felicidades al vendedor, los controles son excelentes y me gusta mucho el color

Shigeru Miyamoto created a masterpiece when he createdthe Mario Bros. series and this game is no exception.I first played Mario Bros. 2 during the late 1980's orearly 1990's and it was much better then Mario Bros.,it had better graphics, sound, gameplay and the enemiesand bosses as well as levels were much more interestingand trippy this time around.You could also play as either Mario, Luigi, Peach or Toad.I give this game 5/5 stars and thanks goes to my Mom for buyingthis game for me as well as my NES in the first place!;)Here is an excellent and detailed review which best sums upthis great game which I have edited and left SMB All Stars out.From:[...]There is only one way to describe Super Mario Bros. 2 . . . . And that word is: Odd.As the second game in the series, Mario Bros. 2 does exactly everything that you WOULDN'T expect from a sequel to the first game. It takes the characters in the Mario universe, adds them to a strange and quirky world, and then takes the gameplay of the first game and absolutely tips it on it's head.There are several design changes that factor in to making Super Mario Bros. 2 so different from the first game in the way it plays. First off is the elimination of the timer. Since there is no timer on any of the levels, you are no longer racing to try and finish the game as fast as you can. The second difference is the fact that you can go backwards in a level. In the original game, when the level scrolled, you could no longer go back in that direction (which made sense in Mario 1 because you are always racing to reach the end of the level before the timer runs out and you die, so there is no reason to go back).Thirdly . . . while Super Mario Bros. 1 popularized the aspect of a side-scrolling game, meaning that the screen scrolls to reveal a bigger playfield (instead of being confined to a single-screen as in games like Pac-Man or Galaga) it was still a game that was confined in the sense that you could only go forwards, you were forced to go forwards (even though you scrolled the screen yourself). Super Mario Bros. 2 changed all that by letting the scrolling of the level, either forwards or backwards, be completely up to the player.However the biggest change did not come from the aforementioned improvements, but rather from another improvement . . . one that you didn't really see much of in the first Super Mario Bros. This sequel let the player explore the world in a whole new way . . . a new dimension. And that dimension was vertically. Mario 2 opens up the whole notion of vertical gameplay to the player. Whether it's jumping onto platform after platform that are suspended in the air, or climbing vines or ladders, Super Mario Bros. 2 sends the player vertically just as often as you scroll left or right, which is a dramatic change.The combination of the lack of a timer, the ability to go backwards and the insistence of the levels in pushing you upwards, gives Super Mario Bros. 2 a COMPLETELY different feel as far as level design goes. And that vertical aspect comes into play as soon as you start the game and are immediately dropped from a door in the sky to the ground below you.Believe it or not, these are not the only changes that separate Super Mario Bros. 2 from it's prequel.But I'm getting ahead of myself here. First a look at some history. Although many do not know it, one reason that Super Mario Bros. 2 is so different from all the other games in the series is because it originally was not a Mario game at all! What we know in America as Super Mario Bros. 2 was actually a game that was only released in Japan. This game was developed by Nintendo and called Doki Doki Panic. Actually the full title is Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panikku which translates to Dream Factory: Doki Doki Panic.This quirky NES game was Mario-ized and brought to America and other regions as Super Mario Bros. 2. The Mario version was also later released in Japan as Super Mario USA.The real sequel to Super Mario Bros. was actually a game that was strikingly similar to the first game. Matter of fact it was really just a remixed version. It was much more difficult than the original and allowed you to play single-player as either Mario or Luigi, with both characters having different abilities (Luigi jumped higher but was harder to stop once he took off running). It also added the new Poisonous Mushroom (identified by their purple color) to the equation. If you grabbed a Poisonous Mushroom it'd harm you rather than help you.Nintendo of Japan however had a hard time deciding whether or not to release Super Mario Bros. 2 (Jap) in the US, fearing that it would be too difficult for American players (it was common in the Japanese video game world at that time to underestimate the abilities of American and European players, even though we had no problem with supremely tough games like Metroid or Contra).So they decided to take another game that they thought was easier (which is quite ironic, cause it's definitely not an easy game) and modify the game, making it into a Mario title to release in the US as Super Mario Bros. 2. The game was developed in cooperation with Fuji Television (who licensed the characters for Nintendo to use) to promote their Yume Kj '87 event in Japan, which showcased several of Fuji TV's latest TV shows and other products at the time. Doki Doki Panic featured the mascots of the Yume Kj festival (an Arabian family consisting of siblings Imajin and Lina and their parents, Papa and Mama) as its main characters and the rest of the characters, including the main villain, Mamu (Renamed Wart for the modified American version), were all original creations by Nintendo for the game.Doki Doki Panic takes place within a book with this Arabian or Indian setting (which explains the desert landscapes and Arabian-style sounding music) where all four characters are sucked into it's world. They are all playable as well, and the game is not completed until the player plays through the game as all four of them, unlike in the American remake.For the modified US version of Doki Doki Panic, Mario corresponds to the Imajin character, Princess Toadstool (or Peach as she's known now) corresponds to Lina, Luigi corresponds to Mama and the stout Papa corresponds to Toad.So Nintendo did all this modifying (leaving most of the game exactly the same, including the enemies and bosses and most of the music and sound effects) thinking that no American player would know the difference. And they were right. Unless you worked in the video game industry or for gaming publications and were in the know, then you'd never realize that what you were playing was not a "true" Mario game.Super Mario Bros. 2 (US) was widely accepted by the people that played it despite it's oddball flavor, and it become so popular and infamous for it's uniqueness that it actually became considered by Nintendo as the real Super Mario Bros. 2 and took it's place alongside the other core games in the Mario saga (Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, and 3, Super Mario World, Super Mario 64, etc.).And the elements of Super Mario Bros. 2 (US) that weren't originally Mario but Doki, such as the enemies like Bob-Ombs, Birdo and Shy Guy`s (who were unchanged from their Doki Doki Panic origins), actually became part of the Mario universe.Nowadays Birdo has developed more into a full-fledged Mario mascot character and taken his place alongside Yoshi; as is evidenced by her appearance as a Yoshi team-up character in Mario Kart: Double Dash on GameCube and in some Mario sports titles.Had Nintendo never converted Doki Doki Panic into a Mario game and released it as such in the US, then many of the beloved characters that people now love would never have existed. And that would definitely be a shame.So I for one am glad that we got this Nintendo game instead of the "real" Super Mario Bros. 2 [Jap] since it is much more unique and original than what we would have gotten, and the new enemies that came along for the ride ended up being great additions to the Mario family (The Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 btw would later hit America for the Super Nintendo as part of the Super Mario All-Stars compilation, in which it was included as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels)So . . . now getting back to the differences in gameplay between Super Mario Bros. 1 and this Super Mario Bros. 2 (US). Whereas the main form of attack in the original game is jumping on the heads of the various enemies, this game changed all that by allowing every enemy in the game (virtually) to be picked up and thrown. Matter of fact, there are no enemies in the game that can be destroyed by jumping on their heads! Your form of attack is now exclusively picking up and throwing. And it's not just enemies that you can pick up and throw at other enemies, but lots of other things as well. For example, the game is also littered with . . . . VEGETABLES! Veggies can be pulled out of the ground and hurled to kill enemies (All enemies in the game die with one hit outside of bosses) and you will find that they play a prominent role throughout the game. They appear in both small and large varieties.Super Mario Bros. 2 was also the first Mario game to introduce other playable characters, which was a huge change from the first game. In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as not only Mario and Luigi, but also the Princess and Toad. While both of the latter characters did appear in the first Super Mario Bros., it was really Super Mario Bros. 2 that popularized them and made legions of fans of those characters since it was our first shot at actually being able to play as them. And even though they were simply character swaps for the Doki characters, most people, like me, didn't know that as kids and took a personal liking to the Toad and Princess characters. I have always loved Toad ever since I played Super Mario Bros. 2 when I was about 5 years old. I thought the little guy was great (and I'm still holding out hope that he'll get his own spot as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl).Each character has their own abilities that make them useful in different situations. The speed at which they run or the height of their jump when holding an item, the speed at which they lift items, and the height of their jump all differs between characters.Mario (typical nowadays) is the "average" character, he doesn't really excel at any one ability. Luigi is the character with the highest jump, he's also the tallest character. Toad is the shortest of the bunch and also the quickest at running and lifting, but he also has the lowest jump. Princess on the other hand is the slowest lifter, but she has an ability that's completely unique to her character (and one she inherited for her debut in Super Smash Bros. Melee) . . . if you hold the jump button, she can FLOAT for a short time! This almost makes her a kind of unfair character as she really is a great choice no matter what level you are on cause you can almost always benefit from her floating ability.As for the other features of Mario, such as coins and items, everything in Super Mario Bros. 2 has been changed up or altered from the first game. Although the way you progress from level to level is still largely the same, as there are a number of worlds and each world has 3 levels, and it uses the same dash system, so world 2-2 would mean the second level on the second world. Pipes though, a major feature of the first Super Mario Bros. have been replaced with these objects that look like vases, some of which can be entered by pressing down, leading inside the vase, much like a pipe in the first game.You now have a life bar made up of hearts on the left side of the screen. If you lose all your hearts by getting hit, then the containers will empty and you will die. If you only have one heart then you are small. You start with two containers, and can get up to four in any one level (containers do not carry on to the next level).If you are small, then getting another heart or a Mushroom will make you grow. Mushrooms are the only way you can get another heart container, and you only find Mushrooms in what is known as "sub-con", which is basically another dimension of the world. Throughout the levels are a certain number of these red potions. You will pull them up from the ground like a vegetable. If you throw the potion, it will create a door. Enter that door and whatever is on the screen will turn dark to signify that you are in another dimension, in "sub-con".Sub-con is a big part of the game. Mushrooms, as well as coins, only appear in sub-con. But Mushrooms only appear in a specific spot. So to get that Mushroom, you are required to throw the door at the place where you think a Mushroom may be. While it's true that Mushrooms theoretically can appear anywhere in a level, they will generally appear in some obvious places, usually where you find many vegetables or something else to give you a hint. Vegetables in Sub-Con turn into coins (one veggie counts as one coin). Coins count towards how many tries you will have at the slot machine in between stages, where you can earn extra lives (and it is the only way to earn extra lives outside of some uncommon 1-Up Mushrooms that you will occasionally pull from the ground).The last big piece of the Super Mario Bros. 2 world are cherries. Cherries kind of take the place of coins in the previous Super Mario Bros., that is, while outside Sub-Con you will see cherries just floating in the air, as coins did in the previous game (actually, they aren't so much floating as nailed, literally, to the air). Grabbing enough cherries will summon a Starman, which works just as in Super Mario Bros. and will give you invincibility for a short amount of time.Super Mario Bros. 2 keeps a nice balance in the way the various game mechanics come into play. For example, unlike most games, the only way to heal yourself (outside a Mushroom) is by killing enemies, which will summon a heart to come floating onto the screen from below, collect it to fill a heart container. This helps in giving you a reason to actually kill enemies instead of simply running past them. You will also occasionally come across other items that you will pull from the ground. These include Shells, which you throw and jump on top of as they slide across the ground, killing any enemies in their path, Stop Watches, which you will pull from the ground once you've pulled 5 big vegetables. Stop Watches will freeze time for a short period. You will also occasionally come across "POW" blocks. These big black boxes will shake the screen once thrown and destroy any enemy that's touching the ground. POW's are still a really cool part of the Mario universe, although they haven't shown up as prominently since Super Mario Bros. 2. But they did make a cameo appearence in the first Super Smash Bros. on the Classic Mushroom Kingdom stage and they occasionally will pop-up in different Mario titles.The last real item you'll come across are bombs. Similar to in the Zelda series, you will come across bricks which can be blown up by using bombs. Bombs will explode a bit after you pick them up and you pull them from the ground like you would vegetables. Bombs will always appear near where they need to be used.And speaking of bombs, this segues into the almost puzzle like aspects of Super Mario Bros. 2. There are many points in the game where you will have to bomb walls or bricks in a certain way. For example, there may be a platform above a lower one, with breaks and walls that can be bombed, blocking the middle of the bottom platform. And if you go into sub-con a Mushroom will appear, but you may only be able to get that Mushroom if you have bombed the right spots.Early on you will come to a secret where you need to drop a bomb down a skinny area where a bombable wall is blocking the door. But it's only wide enough for your character and if you fall or climb down you don't have enough room to throw the bomb. So you gotta drop it from above, and the key is to wait for the bomb to flash and time your throw so that it blows up at the right time, destroying at least two blocks, which will give you enough room to fit in through the gap. And these types of little bombing areas are numerous.Unlike the original Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2 is a lot more non-linear. You can pretty much complete the levels as slow or as quick as you want, for the reasons mentioned above, but also the world itself is also a lot more complex.The world in Super Mario Bros. 2 is full of doors. All the doors can be entered and exited by pressing the Up Button. And there is almost no point where you can not re-enter a door, leaving the player free to explore the world pretty much at their leisure. Doors can lead to all kinds of places, and some levels will have over ten doors (or much less . . . or more), leading in and out of various areas. You will also find many places that are populated with vines, ladders (leading to higher or lower levels) and vases, some of which can be entered. Making the world of Super Mario Bros. 2 a lot larger with various areas and environments within one level. Which is a big improvement over the original game.Super Mario Bros. 2 has great variety in the design of it's levels. Some worlds are themed to a degree as well. You will come across desert landscapes, ice and snow levels, and more green, tropical style levels (complete with Palm Trees), which generally come with a lot of waterfalls. The first time you see a desert stage though, or even the initial level with it's waterfalls, you will realize how big of an improvement the game is graphically over the original Mario Bros.Stages have their own quirks too that make them different. Desert stages for example will have pyramids that you can enter. Once you're inside you will find that you will need to press the B Button to dig through the soft sand. Digging will have the character pull out that space of dirt right below them . . . . and there is lots of dirt! Generally you will have to dig about 5 or more screens before you reach the bottom, encountering enemies and cherries along the way. This mechanic still feels really cool and I can't even think of another game that's similar in the digging department.You will also encounter locked doors in Super Mario Bros. 2, and they will require a key that you will have to pick up and carry from one location (generally far away) to the location of the door that is locked. Picking up a key will summon these faces/masks called Phanto`s, that are on the wall and will chase after you. If you throw the key they will go away until you pick it up again, and they can't be killed.A lot of these locked doors will be found inside these kind of construction/warehouse type environments (though like the first game, much of Super Mario Bros. 2 is only black backgrounds), where you will find chains you can climb, Mushroom Blocks you can pick up, stack and throw, and various hazards ranging from Sparky enemies that will encircle platforms and harm you if you touch them, to spikes or even pits where you will die or be damaged if you fall.The non-linear nature of Super Mario Bros. 2 really comes into play throughout the game. You will come to find that lots of levels actually have multiple paths you can take. Or at least two paths. And many of them feature secrets that will lead to "backdoors", these doors will take you directly to the boss of the level, or to our pal Birdo.Birdo is a strange dinosaur-like creature who spits eggs out at you and serves as a boss, mini-boss and all around common enemy throughout the game. You will fight different varieties of Birdo in different environments. The main form of attack Birdo has is spitting out eggs, which you jump on top of and throw back at him (her? In the new games it's a girl) to kill it. You will also encounter Birdo's that spit fire. At the end of nearly every stage will be a Birdo fight. So learn to enjoy them!The end of the level, generally after a Birdo fight will lead you to a pearl that when picked up will open this "Bird Door" that will lead to the next level. The Bird Door only helps to give the game it's dreamy, otherwordly kind of feel.While Super Mario Bros. 2 is easily one of the best games from my childhood and thus it has a lot of nostalgic value, playing through it again has made me realize how many memorable moments the game has. And that I believe is it's biggest difference from the first Super Mario Bros. game. The stages are SOO unique. And there really are too many cool moments to name.One level for example has a giant waterfall. You start about half-way, and there are clouds leading upward, which is the direction to go if you want to proceed through the level. If, however, you jump down, you will fall and in the middle at the bottom of the waterfall is a little island (if you miss the island you fall to your doom). There is a door on the lil' isle, go inside and you will find a room packed full of veggies. And somewhere in there is a potion, if you can find it all those veggies (or as much as you can pull, if you haven't pulled them up before entering Sub-Con) will of course be coins. And you get the Mushroom as well.Another level has a huge uncrossable gap. The only way to cross it is to use Birdo! He'll shoot an egg and you can actually jump on top of that egg and it will sail you across to the other side. Don't forget to take the potion with you! Another waterfall level has you crossing the waterfalls by jumping on top of fish which will jump up from below. But you have to be careful because if you fall you'll die. Still another level has you sailing on top of a bird! With no ground beneath! Another stage features whales. These whales will shoot water out of their blow holes which you can stand on to get to the higher platforms.And that is just the tip of the iceberg! The levels in Super Mario Bros. 2 easily and single-handedly eclipse anything in the original Super Mario Bros. From the digging to the ice worlds to the secrets to the backdoors and multiple paths to the various environments to the warp pipes to the bosses, Super Mario Bros. 2 is one diverse game.And you really get better the more you play too. As in the example above of the room with a ton of vegetables demonstrates (you will encounter a lot of similar rooms), the player will benefit from actually knowing the layout of the stages and knowing where Mushrooms, Potions and whatnot are located.And did I mention the bosses? This game has some really cool boss fights. Such as Mouser, a mouse who will hurl bombs at you. You have to catch the bombs and toss or set them up on his platform, timing them right so that they explode and hit him as he gets close to them. Or Fry Guy, a big flame-head that will fly around the room dropping little fires. You have to use the Mushroom Blocks in the room to hit him three times (which is the sweet spot for most bosses) by using the platforms above where he flies, after which he'll burst into four little flames that must be extinguished before he is completely defeated.A cool element of the Fry Guy fight is the fact that, while the fight takes place on one-screen, you can keep going through the edge of the screen at which point you'll pop-out on the other side. In fact, if you go half-way, then half of you will be on one-side and the other half will be on the other side! You can even hurl a Mushroom Block at the edge of the screen and, naturally, watch it sail onto the other side, hopefully hitting Fry Guy in the process.This kind of effect is really neat and a far cry from anything you see in the first Super Mario Bros. And there are other levels where this effect will come into play as well. One stage in particular has you hopping on platforms to reach the top of the screen, where-in it will scroll up one, until you reach the top of the environment. But while on a single screen and hopping on the platforms leading up, there are platforms on the edges which you can stand on and if you keep going to the edge of the screen you'll pop-up on the platform on the opposite side. So while you are going up you'll encounter plants that will be coming down . .. this plant will shoot fire that will fall both on the left and right of the plant. The only way to avoid it is to run across the platforms at the edge to pop out on the other side of the screen if the fire is coming your way. It's hard to describe but in the actual game it happens seemlessly and is a cool gameplay effect.And it's this type of unique gameplay that makes the game really imaginative and fun. You really haven't seen anything like it, and even today it is unique among 2D 8-bit platformers. It's also interesting that you actually seem to do a lot more platforming and jumping in Super Mario Bros. 2 than you do in the original, which is ironic considering how the original is all about jumping. The world in Super Mario Bors. 2 is HUGE too compared to the original Super Mario Bros., and the game, if played straight through, is much longer, at least twice if not three times as long.Super Mario Bros. 2 also contains an incredible amount of secrets. You will find many pathways which will lead off the beaten path. Generally they will either take you to an area full of coins, or they will lead to a backdoor that will quickly take you past the level and directly to the boss. The first time you find one of these and you find yourself entering the boss stage by jumping down from the dirt roof at the top it will hit you that this is one unique game (the roof area is just a straight wall leading to the top of the screen and naturally there is no way to get up there from the other side).And secrets like the one mentioned above litter the levels. And many of these are really memorable moments that will probably stick with you after you have completed the game. And for those that have played Super Mario Bros. 2 before it will be really gratifying encountering these nostalgic scenes again. I know for me it brought many fond memories flooding back into my brain.I mean who doesn't remember throwing Mushroom Blocks on top of clouds so that you could stand on them and cross the gap? (even though Princess can simply float across). Or letting the quicksand in one level take you UNDER the starting wall . . . which leads to a backdoor to the boss? If you haven't encountered these secerts then you really owe it to yourself to experience it.The game even contains some well hidden warp pipes (er . . . warp vases?), which will transport you to another world. The warp pipes are cool to find as they can only be found/discovered in Sub-Con, and you will only know it's a warp pipe by entering it. Can you find them all?The game is also surprisingly difficult. Yet it's rarely frustrating, which is a nice balance. It can be easy to die and you will die quite a bit, but you will always feel that it was your own mistake that killed you, not anything cheap. And due to the slot machine in between levels and how many coins you find, you will generally have lots of extra lives, so getting "Game Over" is pretty hard to do unless you are super reckless.Graphic-wise, the game is really colorful in comparison to Super Mario Bros. 1, which has a really dull color pallet, although the NES version of Super Mario Bros. 2 isn't nearly as colorful as the All-Stars version, which also has characters that are much, much improved. And obviously the environments are a lot more diverse, with desert landscapes, ice, waterfalls, frozen places, and more. It really gives the game a lot of variety and you will never get bored with the levels.All the tunes in the game are good and if you played the game back in the day then they will definitely bring back some extremely nostalgic memories and feelings. The music is nice, happy and upbeat, except for the inside/warehouse type tune, which is perfectly fitting. While the music is pretty great overall, there really are only a few tunes which play throughout the whole game which can get old.Super Mario Bros. 2 actually has quite a lot of replay value. I played the game start to finish three times for this review. The first time I used warp pipes (skipping some worlds entirely), the second time I followed secrets and back doors (skipping large parts of some levels) and the third time I played straight through without using any secrets or back doors. So the game contains a lot of replay value for a game of it's age.All in all, Super Mario Bros. 2 is a phenomenal platformer by anyone's standards. It holds up to the test of time extremely well and is no less fun nowadays. And if you've never played the game before then you surely are in for a great time. There are tons of secrets to discover and it's very likely that you will play the game several times if you want to see the entire game. The gameplay is so unique that I can't even think of a modern game (or classic one for that matter), that comes close to mimicking what is on display in Super Mario Bros. 2. And even if it did, Super Mario Bros. 2 definitely does it best. The gameplay is so refined that it's practically perfect. Any complaints I have are so minimal they aren't even worth mentioning.Super Mario Bros. 2 is a definite classic that all gamers should have in their library.Should I buy Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Wii?As the most unique and different Mario game in the series, there is no reason why you shouldn't purchase this $5 NES title on the Wii. Whether you have played it before or not, it's probably still worth purchasing due to the sheer amount of replay value it has for an 8-bit pre Super Mario Bros. 3 title.Even if you have played it extensively, it's still a fun game and there is surely some parts of the game you haven't seen. So why not add it to your collection? And the Wii will make it much easier to get the game for those that don't want to play it on a portable system and don't feel like tracking it down for one of their older consoles (SNES and NES) and having to deal with cartridge problems.FUN FACTOR: 8.0With it's pick-up-and-throw gameplay, bevy of secrets and really unique worlds, the gameplay stays fun throughout the 7 worlds of the game, with lots to see; requiring a few play-throughs before you will see it all.Graphics: 8.5The game looks great . . . for an NES title. While it is very colorful compared to Super Mario Bros., it still looks dull today, especially the characters, and especially in comparison to the SNES All-Stars version. The unique environments make up for the graphical detail though.Ingenuity: 9.0This is by far, with the exception of perhaps Yoshi's Island, the most unique game in the 2D Super Mario Bros. series. No other game involves picking up and throwing things in the way Mario 2 does, and while it's not mind-blowing nowdays, it was for the time. And even now it still feels highly original and the gameplay is refined to near perfection. The idea of Sub-Con is also really neat and was highly original for the time as well.Replay Value: 8.5Due to multiple paths, lots of secrets, hidden warp pipes and back doors, Super Mario Bros. 2 is not a game where you can see everything your first play-through. It will take a few play-throughs to see all that it has to offer, and the game stays pretty fun throughout even though you are simply hurtling things beginning to end. Most people who want to see all the games has to offer will want to play more than once, which is pretty good for this type of game since there are no difficulties, no extra modes and no 2-player.
Shigeru Miyamoto created a masterpiece when he createdthe Mario Bros. series and this game is no exception.I first played Mario Bros. 2 during the late 1980's orearly 1990's and it was much better then Mario Bros.,it had better graphics, sound, gameplay and the enemiesand bosses as well as levels were much more interestingand trippy this time around.You could also play as either Mario, Luigi, Peach or Toad.I give this game 5/5 stars and thanks goes to my Mom for buyingthis game for me as well as my NES in the first place!;)Here is an excellent and detailed review which best sums upthis great game which I have edited and left SMB All Stars out.From:[...]There is only one way to describe Super Mario Bros. 2 . . . . And that word is: Odd.As the second game in the series, Mario Bros. 2 does exactly everything that you WOULDN'T expect from a sequel to the first game. It takes the characters in the Mario universe, adds them to a strange and quirky world, and then takes the gameplay of the first game and absolutely tips it on it's head.There are several design changes that factor in to making Super Mario Bros. 2 so different from the first game in the way it plays. First off is the elimination of the timer. Since there is no timer on any of the levels, you are no longer racing to try and finish the game as fast as you can. The second difference is the fact that you can go backwards in a level. In the original game, when the level scrolled, you could no longer go back in that direction (which made sense in Mario 1 because you are always racing to reach the end of the level before the timer runs out and you die, so there is no reason to go back).Thirdly . . . while Super Mario Bros. 1 popularized the aspect of a side-scrolling game, meaning that the screen scrolls to reveal a bigger playfield (instead of being confined to a single-screen as in games like Pac-Man or Galaga) it was still a game that was confined in the sense that you could only go forwards, you were forced to go forwards (even though you scrolled the screen yourself). Super Mario Bros. 2 changed all that by letting the scrolling of the level, either forwards or backwards, be completely up to the player.However the biggest change did not come from the aforementioned improvements, but rather from another improvement . . . one that you didn't really see much of in the first Super Mario Bros. This sequel let the player explore the world in a whole new way . . . a new dimension. And that dimension was vertically. Mario 2 opens up the whole notion of vertical gameplay to the player. Whether it's jumping onto platform after platform that are suspended in the air, or climbing vines or ladders, Super Mario Bros. 2 sends the player vertically just as often as you scroll left or right, which is a dramatic change.The combination of the lack of a timer, the ability to go backwards and the insistence of the levels in pushing you upwards, gives Super Mario Bros. 2 a COMPLETELY different feel as far as level design goes. And that vertical aspect comes into play as soon as you start the game and are immediately dropped from a door in the sky to the ground below you.Believe it or not, these are not the only changes that separate Super Mario Bros. 2 from it's prequel.But I'm getting ahead of myself here. First a look at some history. Although many do not know it, one reason that Super Mario Bros. 2 is so different from all the other games in the series is because it originally was not a Mario game at all! What we know in America as Super Mario Bros. 2 was actually a game that was only released in Japan. This game was developed by Nintendo and called Doki Doki Panic. Actually the full title is Yume Kj: Doki Doki Panikku which translates to Dream Factory: Doki Doki Panic.This quirky NES game was Mario-ized and brought to America and other regions as Super Mario Bros. 2. The Mario version was also later released in Japan as Super Mario USA.The real sequel to Super Mario Bros. was actually a game that was strikingly similar to the first game. Matter of fact it was really just a remixed version. It was much more difficult than the original and allowed you to play single-player as either Mario or Luigi, with both characters having different abilities (Luigi jumped higher but was harder to stop once he took off running). It also added the new Poisonous Mushroom (identified by their purple color) to the equation. If you grabbed a Poisonous Mushroom it'd harm you rather than help you.Nintendo of Japan however had a hard time deciding whether or not to release Super Mario Bros. 2 (Jap) in the US, fearing that it would be too difficult for American players (it was common in the Japanese video game world at that time to underestimate the abilities of American and European players, even though we had no problem with supremely tough games like Metroid or Contra).So they decided to take another game that they thought was easier (which is quite ironic, cause it's definitely not an easy game) and modify the game, making it into a Mario title to release in the US as Super Mario Bros. 2. The game was developed in cooperation with Fuji Television (who licensed the characters for Nintendo to use) to promote their Yume Kj '87 event in Japan, which showcased several of Fuji TV's latest TV shows and other products at the time. Doki Doki Panic featured the mascots of the Yume Kj festival (an Arabian family consisting of siblings Imajin and Lina and their parents, Papa and Mama) as its main characters and the rest of the characters, including the main villain, Mamu (Renamed Wart for the modified American version), were all original creations by Nintendo for the game.Doki Doki Panic takes place within a book with this Arabian or Indian setting (which explains the desert landscapes and Arabian-style sounding music) where all four characters are sucked into it's world. They are all playable as well, and the game is not completed until the player plays through the game as all four of them, unlike in the American remake.For the modified US version of Doki Doki Panic, Mario corresponds to the Imajin character, Princess Toadstool (or Peach as she's known now) corresponds to Lina, Luigi corresponds to Mama and the stout Papa corresponds to Toad.So Nintendo did all this modifying (leaving most of the game exactly the same, including the enemies and bosses and most of the music and sound effects) thinking that no American player would know the difference. And they were right. Unless you worked in the video game industry or for gaming publications and were in the know, then you'd never realize that what you were playing was not a "true" Mario game.Super Mario Bros. 2 (US) was widely accepted by the people that played it despite it's oddball flavor, and it become so popular and infamous for it's uniqueness that it actually became considered by Nintendo as the real Super Mario Bros. 2 and took it's place alongside the other core games in the Mario saga (Super Mario Bros. 1, 2, and 3, Super Mario World, Super Mario 64, etc.).And the elements of Super Mario Bros. 2 (US) that weren't originally Mario but Doki, such as the enemies like Bob-Ombs, Birdo and Shy Guy`s (who were unchanged from their Doki Doki Panic origins), actually became part of the Mario universe.Nowadays Birdo has developed more into a full-fledged Mario mascot character and taken his place alongside Yoshi; as is evidenced by her appearance as a Yoshi team-up character in Mario Kart: Double Dash on GameCube and in some Mario sports titles.Had Nintendo never converted Doki Doki Panic into a Mario game and released it as such in the US, then many of the beloved characters that people now love would never have existed. And that would definitely be a shame.So I for one am glad that we got this Nintendo game instead of the "real" Super Mario Bros. 2 [Jap] since it is much more unique and original than what we would have gotten, and the new enemies that came along for the ride ended up being great additions to the Mario family (The Japanese Super Mario Bros. 2 btw would later hit America for the Super Nintendo as part of the Super Mario All-Stars compilation, in which it was included as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels)So . . . now getting back to the differences in gameplay between Super Mario Bros. 1 and this Super Mario Bros. 2 (US). Whereas the main form of attack in the original game is jumping on the heads of the various enemies, this game changed all that by allowing every enemy in the game (virtually) to be picked up and thrown. Matter of fact, there are no enemies in the game that can be destroyed by jumping on their heads! Your form of attack is now exclusively picking up and throwing. And it's not just enemies that you can pick up and throw at other enemies, but lots of other things as well. For example, the game is also littered with . . . . VEGETABLES! Veggies can be pulled out of the ground and hurled to kill enemies (All enemies in the game die with one hit outside of bosses) and you will find that they play a prominent role throughout the game. They appear in both small and large varieties.Super Mario Bros. 2 was also the first Mario game to introduce other playable characters, which was a huge change from the first game. In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as not only Mario and Luigi, but also the Princess and Toad. While both of the latter characters did appear in the first Super Mario Bros., it was really Super Mario Bros. 2 that popularized them and made legions of fans of those characters since it was our first shot at actually being able to play as them. And even though they were simply character swaps for the Doki characters, most people, like me, didn't know that as kids and took a personal liking to the Toad and Princess characters. I have always loved Toad ever since I played Super Mario Bros. 2 when I was about 5 years old. I thought the little guy was great (and I'm still holding out hope that he'll get his own spot as a playable character in Super Smash Bros. Brawl).Each character has their own abilities that make them useful in different situations. The speed at which they run or the height of their jump when holding an item, the speed at which they lift items, and the height of their jump all differs between characters.Mario (typical nowadays) is the "average" character, he doesn't really excel at any one ability. Luigi is the character with the highest jump, he's also the tallest character. Toad is the shortest of the bunch and also the quickest at running and lifting, but he also has the lowest jump. Princess on the other hand is the slowest lifter, but she has an ability that's completely unique to her character (and one she inherited for her debut in Super Smash Bros. Melee) . . . if you hold the jump button, she can FLOAT for a short time! This almost makes her a kind of unfair character as she really is a great choice no matter what level you are on cause you can almost always benefit from her floating ability.As for the other features of Mario, such as coins and items, everything in Super Mario Bros. 2 has been changed up or altered from the first game. Although the way you progress from level to level is still largely the same, as there are a number of worlds and each world has 3 levels, and it uses the same dash system, so world 2-2 would mean the second level on the second world. Pipes though, a major feature of the first Super Mario Bros. have been replaced with these objects that look like vases, some of which can be entered by pressing down, leading inside the vase, much like a pipe in the first game.You now have a life bar made up of hearts on the left side of the screen. If you lose all your hearts by getting hit, then the containers will empty and you will die. If you only have one heart then you are small. You start with two containers, and can get up to four in any one level (containers do not carry on to the next level).If you are small, then getting another heart or a Mushroom will make you grow. Mushrooms are the only way you can get another heart container, and you only find Mushrooms in what is known as "sub-con", which is basically another dimension of the world. Throughout the levels are a certain number of these red potions. You will pull them up from the ground like a vegetable. If you throw the potion, it will create a door. Enter that door and whatever is on the screen will turn dark to signify that you are in another dimension, in "sub-con".Sub-con is a big part of the game. Mushrooms, as well as coins, only appear in sub-con. But Mushrooms only appear in a specific spot. So to get that Mushroom, you are required to throw the door at the place where you think a Mushroom may be. While it's true that Mushrooms theoretically can appear anywhere in a level, they will generally appear in some obvious places, usually where you find many vegetables or something else to give you a hint. Vegetables in Sub-Con turn into coins (one veggie counts as one coin). Coins count towards how many tries you will have at the slot machine in between stages, where you can earn extra lives (and it is the only way to earn extra lives outside of some uncommon 1-Up Mushrooms that you will occasionally pull from the ground).The last big piece of the Super Mario Bros. 2 world are cherries. Cherries kind of take the place of coins in the previous Super Mario Bros., that is, while outside Sub-Con you will see cherries just floating in the air, as coins did in the previous game (actually, they aren't so much floating as nailed, literally, to the air). Grabbing enough cherries will summon a Starman, which works just as in Super Mario Bros. and will give you invincibility for a short amount of time.Super Mario Bros. 2 keeps a nice balance in the way the various game mechanics come into play. For example, unlike most games, the only way to heal yourself (outside a Mushroom) is by killing enemies, which will summon a heart to come floating onto the screen from below, collect it to fill a heart container. This helps in giving you a reason to actually kill enemies instead of simply running past them. You will also occasionally come across other items that you will pull from the ground. These include Shells, which you throw and jump on top of as they slide across the ground, killing any enemies in their path, Stop Watches, which you will pull from the ground once you've pulled 5 big vegetables. Stop Watches will freeze time for a short period. You will also occasionally come across "POW" blocks. These big black boxes will shake the screen once thrown and destroy any enemy that's touching the ground. POW's are still a really cool part of the Mario universe, although they haven't shown up as prominently since Super Mario Bros. 2. But they did make a cameo appearence in the first Super Smash Bros. on the Classic Mushroom Kingdom stage and they occasionally will pop-up in different Mario titles.The last real item you'll come across are bombs. Similar to in the Zelda series, you will come across bricks which can be blown up by using bombs. Bombs will explode a bit after you pick them up and you pull them from the ground like you would vegetables. Bombs will always appear near where they need to be used.And speaking of bombs, this segues into the almost puzzle like aspects of Super Mario Bros. 2. There are many points in the game where you will have to bomb walls or bricks in a certain way. For example, there may be a platform above a lower one, with breaks and walls that can be bombed, blocking the middle of the bottom platform. And if you go into sub-con a Mushroom will appear, but you may only be able to get that Mushroom if you have bombed the right spots.Early on you will come to a secret where you need to drop a bomb down a skinny area where a bombable wall is blocking the door. But it's only wide enough for your character and if you fall or climb down you don't have enough room to throw the bomb. So you gotta drop it from above, and the key is to wait for the bomb to flash and time your throw so that it blows up at the right time, destroying at least two blocks, which will give you enough room to fit in through the gap. And these types of little bombing areas are numerous.Unlike the original Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 2 is a lot more non-linear. You can pretty much complete the levels as slow or as quick as you want, for the reasons mentioned above, but also the world itself is also a lot more complex.The world in Super Mario Bros. 2 is full of doors. All the doors can be entered and exited by pressing the Up Button. And there is almost no point where you can not re-enter a door, leaving the player free to explore the world pretty much at their leisure. Doors can lead to all kinds of places, and some levels will have over ten doors (or much less . . . or more), leading in and out of various areas. You will also find many places that are populated with vines, ladders (leading to higher or lower levels) and vases, some of which can be entered. Making the world of Super Mario Bros. 2 a lot larger with various areas and environments within one level. Which is a big improvement over the original game.Super Mario Bros. 2 has great variety in the design of it's levels. Some worlds are themed to a degree as well. You will come across desert landscapes, ice and snow levels, and more green, tropical style levels (complete with Palm Trees), which generally come with a lot of waterfalls. The first time you see a desert stage though, or even the initial level with it's waterfalls, you will realize how big of an improvement the game is graphically over the original Mario Bros.Stages have their own quirks too that make them different. Desert stages for example will have pyramids that you can enter. Once you're inside you will find that you will need to press the B Button to dig through the soft sand. Digging will have the character pull out that space of dirt right below them . . . . and there is lots of dirt! Generally you will have to dig about 5 or more screens before you reach the bottom, encountering enemies and cherries along the way. This mechanic still feels really cool and I can't even think of another game that's similar in the digging department.You will also encounter locked doors in Super Mario Bros. 2, and they will require a key that you will have to pick up and carry from one location (generally far away) to the location of the door that is locked. Picking up a key will summon these faces/masks called Phanto`s, that are on the wall and will chase after you. If you throw the key they will go away until you pick it up again, and they can't be killed.A lot of these locked doors will be found inside these kind of construction/warehouse type environments (though like the first game, much of Super Mario Bros. 2 is only black backgrounds), where you will find chains you can climb, Mushroom Blocks you can pick up, stack and throw, and various hazards ranging from Sparky enemies that will encircle platforms and harm you if you touch them, to spikes or even pits where you will die or be damaged if you fall.The non-linear nature of Super Mario Bros. 2 really comes into play throughout the game. You will come to find that lots of levels actually have multiple paths you can take. Or at least two paths. And many of them feature secrets that will lead to "backdoors", these doors will take you directly to the boss of the level, or to our pal Birdo.Birdo is a strange dinosaur-like creature who spits eggs out at you and serves as a boss, mini-boss and all around common enemy throughout the game. You will fight different varieties of Birdo in different environments. The main form of attack Birdo has is spitting out eggs, which you jump on top of and throw back at him (her? In the new games it's a girl) to kill it. You will also encounter Birdo's that spit fire. At the end of nearly every stage will be a Birdo fight. So learn to enjoy them!The end of the level, generally after a Birdo fight will lead you to a pearl that when picked up will open this "Bird Door" that will lead to the next level. The Bird Door only helps to give the game it's dreamy, otherwordly kind of feel.While Super Mario Bros. 2 is easily one of the best games from my childhood and thus it has a lot of nostalgic value, playing through it again has made me realize how many memorable moments the game has. And that I believe is it's biggest difference from the first Super Mario Bros. game. The stages are SOO unique. And there really are too many cool moments to name.One level for example has a giant waterfall. You start about half-way, and there are clouds leading upward, which is the direction to go if you want to proceed through the level. If, however, you jump down, you will fall and in the middle at the bottom of the waterfall is a little island (if you miss the island you fall to your doom). There is a door on the lil' isle, go inside and you will find a room packed full of veggies. And somewhere in there is a potion, if you can find it all those veggies (or as much as you can pull, if you haven't pulled them up before entering Sub-Con) will of course be coins. And you get the Mushroom as well.Another level has a huge uncrossable gap. The only way to cross it is to use Birdo! He'll shoot an egg and you can actually jump on top of that egg and it will sail you across to the other side. Don't forget to take the potion with you! Another waterfall level has you crossing the waterfalls by jumping on top of fish which will jump up from below. But you have to be careful because if you fall you'll die. Still another level has you sailing on top of a bird! With no ground beneath! Another stage features whales. These whales will shoot water out of their blow holes which you can stand on to get to the higher platforms.And that is just the tip of the iceberg! The levels in Super Mario Bros. 2 easily and single-handedly eclipse anything in the original Super Mario Bros. From the digging to the ice worlds to the secrets to the backdoors and multiple paths to the various environments to the warp pipes to the bosses, Super Mario Bros. 2 is one diverse game.And you really get better the more you play too. As in the example above of the room with a ton of vegetables demonstrates (you will encounter a lot of similar rooms), the player will benefit from actually knowing the layout of the stages and knowing where Mushrooms, Potions and whatnot are located.And did I mention the bosses? This game has some really cool boss fights. Such as Mouser, a mouse who will hurl bombs at you. You have to catch the bombs and toss or set them up on his platform, timing them right so that they explode and hit him as he gets close to them. Or Fry Guy, a big flame-head that will fly around the room dropping little fires. You have to use the Mushroom Blocks in the room to hit him three times (which is the sweet spot for most bosses) by using the platforms above where he flies, after which he'll burst into four little flames that must be extinguished before he is completely defeated.A cool element of the Fry Guy fight is the fact that, while the fight takes place on one-screen, you can keep going through the edge of the screen at which point you'll pop-out on the other side. In fact, if you go half-way, then half of you will be on one-side and the other half will be on the other side! You can even hurl a Mushroom Block at the edge of the screen and, naturally, watch it sail onto the other side, hopefully hitting Fry Guy in the process.This kind of effect is really neat and a far cry from anything you see in the first Super Mario Bros. And there are other levels where this effect will come into play as well. One stage in particular has you hopping on platforms to reach the top of the screen, where-in it will scroll up one, until you reach the top of the environment. But while on a single screen and hopping on the platforms leading up, there are platforms on the edges which you can stand on and if you keep going to the edge of the screen you'll pop-up on the platform on the opposite side. So while you are going up you'll encounter plants that will be coming down . .. this plant will shoot fire that will fall both on the left and right of the plant. The only way to avoid it is to run across the platforms at the edge to pop out on the other side of the screen if the fire is coming your way. It's hard to describe but in the actual game it happens seemlessly and is a cool gameplay effect.And it's this type of unique gameplay that makes the game really imaginative and fun. You really haven't seen anything like it, and even today it is unique among 2D 8-bit platformers. It's also interesting that you actually seem to do a lot more platforming and jumping in Super Mario Bros. 2 than you do in the original, which is ironic considering how the original is all about jumping. The world in Super Mario Bors. 2 is HUGE too compared to the original Super Mario Bros., and the game, if played straight through, is much longer, at least twice if not three times as long.Super Mario Bros. 2 also contains an incredible amount of secrets. You will find many pathways which will lead off the beaten path. Generally they will either take you to an area full of coins, or they will lead to a backdoor that will quickly take you past the level and directly to the boss. The first time you find one of these and you find yourself entering the boss stage by jumping down from the dirt roof at the top it will hit you that this is one unique game (the roof area is just a straight wall leading to the top of the screen and naturally there is no way to get up there from the other side).And secrets like the one mentioned above litter the levels. And many of these are really memorable moments that will probably stick with you after you have completed the game. And for those that have played Super Mario Bros. 2 before it will be really gratifying encountering these nostalgic scenes again. I know for me it brought many fond memories flooding back into my brain.I mean who doesn't remember throwing Mushroom Blocks on top of clouds so that you could stand on them and cross the gap? (even though Princess can simply float across). Or letting the quicksand in one level take you UNDER the starting wall . . . which leads to a backdoor to the boss? If you haven't encountered these secerts then you really owe it to yourself to experience it.The game even contains some well hidden warp pipes (er . . . warp vases?), which will transport you to another world. The warp pipes are cool to find as they can only be found/discovered in Sub-Con, and you will only know it's a warp pipe by entering it. Can you find them all?The game is also surprisingly difficult. Yet it's rarely frustrating, which is a nice balance. It can be easy to die and you will die quite a bit, but you will always feel that it was your own mistake that killed you, not anything cheap. And due to the slot machine in between levels and how many coins you find, you will generally have lots of extra lives, so getting "Game Over" is pretty hard to do unless you are super reckless.Graphic-wise, the game is really colorful in comparison to Super Mario Bros. 1, which has a really dull color pallet, although the NES version of Super Mario Bros. 2 isn't nearly as colorful as the All-Stars version, which also has characters that are much, much improved. And obviously the environments are a lot more diverse, with desert landscapes, ice, waterfalls, frozen places, and more. It really gives the game a lot of variety and you will never get bored with the levels.All the tunes in the game are good and if you played the game back in the day then they will definitely bring back some extremely nostalgic memories and feelings. The music is nice, happy and upbeat, except for the inside/warehouse type tune, which is perfectly fitting. While the music is pretty great overall, there really are only a few tunes which play throughout the whole game which can get old.Super Mario Bros. 2 actually has quite a lot of replay value. I played the game start to finish three times for this review. The first time I used warp pipes (skipping some worlds entirely), the second time I followed secrets and back doors (skipping large parts of some levels) and the third time I played straight through without using any secrets or back doors. So the game contains a lot of replay value for a game of it's age.All in all, Super Mario Bros. 2 is a phenomenal platformer by anyone's standards. It holds up to the test of time extremely well and is no less fun nowadays. And if you've never played the game before then you surely are in for a great time. There are tons of secrets to discover and it's very likely that you will play the game several times if you want to see the entire game. The gameplay is so unique that I can't even think of a modern game (or classic one for that matter), that comes close to mimicking what is on display in Super Mario Bros. 2. And even if it did, Super Mario Bros. 2 definitely does it best. The gameplay is so refined that it's practically perfect. Any complaints I have are so minimal they aren't even worth mentioning.Super Mario Bros. 2 is a definite classic that all gamers should have in their library.Should I buy Super Mario Bros. 2 for the Wii?As the most unique and different Mario game in the series, there is no reason why you shouldn't purchase this $5 NES title on the Wii. Whether you have played it before or not, it's probably still worth purchasing due to the sheer amount of replay value it has for an 8-bit pre Super Mario Bros. 3 title.Even if you have played it extensively, it's still a fun game and there is surely some parts of the game you haven't seen. So why not add it to your collection? And the Wii will make it much easier to get the game for those that don't want to play it on a portable system and don't feel like tracking it down for one of their older consoles (SNES and NES) and having to deal with cartridge problems.FUN FACTOR: 8.0With it's pick-up-and-throw gameplay, bevy of secrets and really unique worlds, the gameplay stays fun throughout the 7 worlds of the game, with lots to see; requiring a few play-throughs before you will see it all.Graphics: 8.5The game looks great . . . for an NES title. While it is very colorful compared to Super Mario Bros., it still looks dull today, especially the characters, and especially in comparison to the SNES All-Stars version. The unique environments make up for the graphical detail though.Ingenuity: 9.0This is by far, with the exception of perhaps Yoshi's Island, the most unique game in the 2D Super Mario Bros. series. No other game involves picking up and throwing things in the way Mario 2 does, and while it's not mind-blowing nowdays, it was for the time. And even now it still feels highly original and the gameplay is refined to near perfection. The idea of Sub-Con is also really neat and was highly original for the time as well.Replay Value: 8.5Due to multiple paths, lots of secrets, hidden warp pipes and back doors, Super Mario Bros. 2 is not a game where you can see everything your first play-through. It will take a few play-throughs to see all that it has to offer, and the game stays pretty fun throughout even though you are simply hurtling things beginning to end. Most people who want to see all the games has to offer will want to play more than once, which is pretty good for this type of game since there are no difficulties, no extra modes and no 2-player.
The Legendary Starfy is the fifth game in the long running Densetsu no Stafy (Legendary Starfy) series; however it is the first Starfy game to be released outside of Japan. The game features a brand new style of platforming called &#34;marine platforming&#34; by the developers, and has that Kirbyish charm, but how does it stand compared to the other platforming games on the DS? Well, lets find out!The Story of Starfy:Although The Legendary Starfy is the fifth game in the series, it really doesn't matter. Just like with the past games, The Legendary Starfy features it's own stand alone story, so it is very easy for anyone to just pick up and completely understand what is going on. While throughout the game characters will mention that they've been on adventures before, none of them really effect the events that unfold here.One day the lazy prince Starfy was sleeping in his bed in the floating castle of Pufftop Palace, when all of a sudden a strange rabbit wearing a space suit crashed through the castle and landed on top of him. At first Starfy wasn't quite sure what to do, but when a few strange characters show up to capture the poor creature, Starfy decides to help; however the rabbit had other plans. After using his special spin attack to save him, Starfy finds that the rabbit fell into the ocean below, and the bad guys were still after him. So, being the kind prince he is, Starfy, along with his best friend Moe the clam, decide to jump into the ocean and follow him. Soon after, Starfy and Moe once again find themselves on a grand adventure.Tose and the Starfy Charm:Two things that really make the Starfy series stand out are, the developers who developed the game, and what I like to call the &#34;Starfy Charm.&#34; The Starfy series is an original series created by the almost completely unknown company Tose, but it isn't the only game they have worked on. The thing about Tose is, they are a ghost company who almost always is behind the scenes of just about EVERY game! Yep, that's right, Tose has developed and co-developed thousands of titles, and chances are that includes almost every game you have ever played. They never put their names on the games they work on, and their staff NEVER shows up in the game's credits, they stay completely unknown. From Final Fantasy, to Kid Icarus and even games like Metal Gear Solid on the Game Boy, Tose has a long line of games under their belt, with plenty of game experience. Even so, due to them holding the copyright along side Nintendo, the Starfy series is the only one they call their own.Besides the fact that it's developer is a ghost company, the game itself has quite a lot of charm, and that's what really makes this game stand out. The entire game uses some really nice bright colors, the music is really catchy and sounds like something you would hear in a Kirby game, all of the enemies are cute animals and sea creatures, and Starfy himself just really makes this game pop. His bright yellow colors really stand out, when he runs his feet spin around like Sonic the Hedgehog and he waves his arms and grows big eyes like he's scared of falling down, he can get dizzy if he spins too much, he smiles and flaps his arms as he glides through the air, and he makes cute little &#34;WHEEEEE&#34; sounds from time to time. Starfy is just a really stand out character, and he makes the entire game enjoyable!Besides how the game looks, there are a few other little touches Tose threw in which really help give the game character as well. Whenever you open and close your DS, you'll hear Starfy make his &#34;WHEEE&#34; sounds, and whenever character's are talking on the touch screen, they'll open and close their mouth and turn around in sync. Although neither of these features are anything major, it is pretty nice to see a game that uses the close/open feature for something other than single use story events, and it is also really nice to see the characters actually move as the talk instead of just having still images. Really, they're both just something you'll have to hear and see for yourself.The Gameplay of Marine Platforming:As I said before, the Starfy series uses a brand new style of platforming gameplay which Tose calls &#34;Marine Platforming.&#34; Since most of the Starfy series takes place underwater, Tose has created a game where the sea creatures can make full use of that water, and do things other games just tend to avoid.While underwater, Starfy can do quite a few different moves, and each one of them actually has different uses. While at the very start of the game his moves are limited, as you go through the adventure more and more become unlocked. Even so, his basic moves always stay the same. First of all, Starfy can move in any direction while he's swimming underwater, and he can also go faster by holding down the B button. By hitting the Y button Starfy can do his famous spin move to attack enemies, but as it gets upgraded it can be used for other things as well.Underwater is a dangerous place, and it is filled with many different enemies, water currents, and obstacles to get in Starfy's way. While some water currents can be pushed through by using his spin moves, others are simply too strong and will require other solutions to get around. From finding hidden paths in walls, to pushing rocks over jet streams, this is what makes up the core gameplay of the underwater sections of Starfy. While the gameplay is actually pretty basic, with enemies not putting up much of a fight, there are actually many secrets to be found in these stages, and you must explore every nook and cranny if you want to get through them. While the first few levels of the game are in fact basic underwater sections, a little bit later on things really start to get creative. Once Starfy starts leaving the water for the land above, things change, and the game truly becomes a unique platformer.While Starfy is on land, his gameplay completely changes, and the game becomes a lot more like a standard platforming game. Stafy can do a weaker version of his spin attack, he can run faster by holding down the attack button, he can jump (and later double jump), and glide, and he can make full use of any traces of water still left around him. For example in some levels water drops will actually be falling from the sky, and Starfy will be able to jump into them, swim through them, and then launch himself into the air to hit the next water drop, or he can use them as platforms to make it to the next area. Soon the game transforms from simply swimming through tunnels, to bouncing off of enemies heads, soaring through the sky, swimming through water suspended in mid air, and using every trick you can think of just to reach that next area. Still, this is only half of the gameplay in The Legendary Starfy.After meeting up with the rabbit, Starfy soon finds that he can transform into different creatures which have their own powers. Although these transformations can only be used in specific areas of the game, each one plays differently, and that really helps change up the gameplay. From running down a forest path burning away vines with a dragon, to turning yourself invisible as a ghost to sneak past enemies, these transformations offer a wide verity of gameplay types, but they are pretty limiting in the end; even so, they do end up playing a major part when it comes to the underline goal of the game.The truth is, above all else, Starfy is a treasure hunting game. There are over one hundred pieces of treasure for Starfy to find during his adventure, and MANY hidden stages to unlock as well. Because of this, you will find yourself searching every inch of each level, solving puzzles you would normally just pass by, and playing mini games just to find that next treasure or unlock that next hidden level. While the game is divided up into worlds, each world has three extra hidden levels, and in these hidden levels you'll find hidden power ups to increase Starfy's health, as well as make his transformations stronger. To go along with the standard treasure hidden in each of the levels, these additions really give you a reason to explore as much as possible; however it still isn't that simple.A lot of the areas you'll come across will actually be off limits the first time you see them. There will either be a strong current blocking your path, enemies that seem to make a bridge but with no true way to get across, or the platform will just be too high to reach. Whenever you come across these sections, it is very clear that Starfy will need to learn some kind of new ability before he can get across, and that's exactly what you'll have to do. You'll have to move on with the game, unlock Starfy's later abilities, and then return to see what you had left behind. Sometimes it was just treasure, but other times it is an entire level, either way you will have to back track if you want to see everything this game has to offer. The good news is, that throughout the game you will also unlock different touch screen features as well. Although most of these are simply there to give you information on how much you've played, and how far you've progressed through the game, others (such as Moe's) will actually help you find the secrets, so you don't always enter a level blind.Mini games and mini side events also play a part in Starfy, but only the latter really matter. Although you will unlock a few mini games to play, they really aren't anything special, and I personally didn't play them more than a few times. While one is a simple fishing game, another is just rubbing the touch screen as fast as possible, and there's also one where you just tap coins on the screen to shoot them. While they may be fun to play from time to time with friends, there really isn't much to offer you if you're going it solo; however the side events are important!As I said before, you can unlock extra levels in each world, but to do so you have to find a door, AND you have to play a mini event. Normally in these mini events one of the sea creatures will ask you for help, and all you have to do is, well, help them. While some events require you to race to the end, others might require you to figure out a little puzzle. Either way these events must be played if you want to unlock the other levels, and they are a very important part of the game. Just a word of advice, you might want to play the game using headphones if you've got them; a few events actually use 3D sound to help track things down, and the DS speakers just don't do it justice.The Multiplayer:The final, main, feature in Starfy is it's multiplayer mode. At the start of some of the levels you can actually talk to Moe and call in Starfy's little sister to help him out. Although she plays a lot like Starfy, she does have access to abilities that Starfy unlocks later in the game, and she even has a few moves Starfy NEVER learns (such as her wall jump). Although this really is a nice addition to the game, there are two down sides to this. First of all, there are some areas of the levels Starfy CANNOT access, so you MUST have a second player if you want to get the rewards, but since this is a DS game it really isn't that simple. If you want to be able to explore every inch of every level, you'll have to own a second DS and either use the single card play, or own another DS and another game card to do the multicard play (which is actually a lot faster). Since buying another DS isn't cheap, chances are this is a feature a lot of people will miss out on.The second major issue with the multiplayer is the fact that it can only be used in a few rooms, normally the first room of each level, and it actually takes quite a bit of time to use. For the sake of this review, I wanted to 100% the game, and explore every inch of every level so I could give a fair review of it; however that required the use of a second DS, and that alone was pretty time consuming. If you only have a single copy of the game, you'll have to talk to Moe, hit download play, turn on your second DS, go to download play and download the Starfy data, and then you have to wait about a minute before you can even play. Sure once you download the game data and start playing everything is fine right? Well, actually, NOPE! The thing is, these two player sections may only last you thirty seconds at most, and once you go through that door at the end, the two player mode ends, and the second player's DS shuts off. Yep, you heard me, it shuts off! Now if you want to play multiplayer again when it allows you to a few rooms later, you'll actually have to do everything all over again. In the end you might actually spend more time waiting for player two to connect than you'll spend time playing.Sure the multiplayer mode is nice, and it can help you out when it comes to fighting bosses, but it is a pretty big pain if you only own one copy of the game, and it really isn't worth messing with unless you're having a hard time fighting a boss; which really shouldn't happen given how easy most of this game is.Pearls and the Shop:One thing I really liked about Starfy is it's whole Pearl system. While most games have coins, rings, or any other object to collect, most of the time it is simply used to collect one hundred of them and to unlock an extra life; however Starfy actually gives an extra use to the whole system! While collecting five pearls will heal Starfy's health some, they also actually go into your pearl count where they can then be spent on little extras. Now these extras really aren't anything major, they are a nice little something to give you a reason to pick the pearls up.The first extra is the whole clothing shop system. Every time you click on &#34;shop&#34; on the main menu, you are given the chance to buy a random piece of clothing which you can put on the 3D model of Starfy (or his sister) which appear on the top screen when the game is paused. Although these pieces of clothing really don't change the game that much, they do allow you to customize your pause screen some, and by completing a clothing set (which only consists of two pieces) you can unlock a special &#34;scene&#34; for the top screen as well. Once again, this really isn't a major feature, but it is a nice little something you can do.The second way these pearls are used is actually in a locked feature which the game doesn't actually allow you to use until you've finished the main game (most likely to avoid spoilers), and that's the toy shop. Basically you can put five pearls into a toy machine, turn the dial, and then open the toy bubble to see what you got. These toys are the enemies and characters you met throughout the game, and they simply provide extra background information on them. Once again, it's not a major feature, but it is kind of nice, and it gives you a reason to keep picking up pearls even after you've got everything from the shop.Post Game:Although Starfy can be beaten in about ten hours, the game actually doesn't end there. Once you finish the game more content opens up, more modes become unlocked, and you can still go back and find any treasure or hidden levels you may have left behind. In the end, although Starfy actually does have a pretty long main game, the game still offers you more reasons to keep on playing, and that's something most games tend to leave out now days. To avoid spoilers I will not say what you all unlock once you finish the game, but I will say it is sure to add on quite a few more hours of gameplay.The Good and the Bad:Starfy is a great game that does a lot of things right, but it also has quite a few problems as well. On the plus side, the game looks really nice, the 2D sprites are nice and colorful, and the 3D backgrounds really help add depth to the game as well. The characters are nice, it has a pretty good (yet simple) story, the mix of underwater and land gameplay was a nice change of pace from what you see in most platformers, the music was great, I really liked the whole pearl system, I liked how the game used 3D sound for some events, and the game was overall REALLY fun! Sure it was simple at times, but a game doesn't always have to be extremely hard to be fun, and this game is a perfect example of that; however there are still some down sides.Although I just said that games don't always have to be hard to be fun, The Legendary Starfy is in fact the easiest game in the Starfy series, and Starfy fans may be a little bit disappointed because of that. The multiplayer mode was also pretty much a pain due to how long it took to connect, and due to the fact that there were areas you could only reach with multiplayer, and the mini games weren't anything special either. Another thing that a lot of people may find annoying is that the touch screen and menus also spoil quite a bit of the game as well, as it lists how many treasures you can find in the world, how many of them pieces of treasure will be notes, how many transformations there are, and it also spoils how many pieces of clothing there are to collect. If you like being kept in the dark about things, I'm sorry to say but Starfy will tell you everything; heck one of the treasures you find at the VERY START of the game spoils that there's a secret boss. That's just something most people tend to enjoy finding out on their own, but this game doesn't allow them to do so. Everything is spelled out for you, and that might be an issue for some.The good news is, the good in Starfy outweighs the bad, and that's what matters. Sure it has it's issues, but it is still a really good game! Personally I'd rate Starfy a 10/10, but that rating just wouldn't be fair. When it comes down to it, The Legendary Starfy deserves a good rating of 8/10. The game is great, but the fact that it is easier may disappoint Starfy fans, and its other few problems really bring it down.Even so, The Legendary Starfy is a star that really shines, and is a must own game if you're a platforming game fan, and you own a DS.
So I'm gunna post my review of the game here... it's big and stuff so I apologize but I didn't wanna start a new thread again.Pokemon X/YWhere to begin... Well I guess at the start. I have been playing Pokemon games since they started. My first game was Pokemon Blue and I have never missed one in the series since. The joy of finding new Pokemon never seems to get old for me. SO when I learned about Pokemon X/Y I was of course Joyful as I usually was when hearing about a new Pokemon game.Nothing could prepare me for this game. Nothing.Gameplay 10/10For those new to Pokemon, You enter a world where we capture, raise, and battle with Animals known as Pokemon. They gain levels, have stats, learn different attacks and each has their own elemental Strengths and Weaknesses attached to them. Fire is weak to water, Water is weak to Grass, Grass is weak to fire etc... there are 18 I believe elements in total and all have their own Rock-Paper-Scissors Pros and Cons. This is back and of course just as fun as ever. Do you want to make a team of all bug Pokemon? Go for it! but know that you will be weak against Flying, Rock and Fire types, and yet strong against Psychic, Poison and Grass etc... Or you could have a team of various Pokemon, ready to fight against all types whenever the need arises. Building your own team has always been a highlight of the series, and with over 700... let me stop right there. SEVEN HUNDRED... different Pokemon to chose from you have a ridiculous number of monsters to chose from to form your 6 slot party. Now not all 700+ are in the game, I believe only around 4-5 hundred are to start, but you can trade Pokemon from previous games up and use them if your friends have it or you can even go back and try the old games etc... But this game has plenty of Pokemon to try out and have fun withFor those that are familiar with Pokemon , this game has everything you would ever want and much MUCH more. First off they have streamlined how leveling your Pokemon works. No longer do you have to Slowly one by one level each of your Pokemon against weak wild Pokemon and then grind more and more and more etc... Instead the game has made a few key changes to how EXP works which I shall list below.1. Any Pokemon that participates in the battle now gets 100% EXP, it no longer gives 50% to one and 50% to another. or 33% to all three etc...2. You get an EXP.Share about 1 hour into the game (After the first gym battle) And this time it is not even a held item! It sits in your inventory and as you fight, any Pokemon that participated in battle gets 100% Exp, any in your party that didn't get 50% exp. This is beyond amazing and is a fantastic way to level your low level Pokemon quickly without having to suffer from putting it in front, and switching out your Pokemon every single fight. If you don't like this feature, you can of course turn it off in the item menu. I suggest not doing so3. Catching a Pokemon still grants you EXP as if you had killed it.As a result of these new EXP changes you spend almost no time simply leveling up Pokemon and instead you will be spending your time trying to catch the Pokemon then you will simply grinding. In fact There are a few Pokemon in each area that aren't quite as common as others. For example in Route 1 there is a Zigzagoon that is harder to find than the more common Pidgey's Fletchings, and Caterpie that wander around. There always seems to be one in each area, and in an attempt to find it you naturally level up your Pokemon (Unless you are running from every battle).Now battles themselves have remained, from a mechanics standpoint, nearly untouched and that's a good thing. There has never been anything wrong with combat in Pokemon and this never needed to be changed. They did of course change the graphics and animations which I will touch on later. There are a lot of smaller, what I like to call Quality of Life Improvements, to the UI and everything that I don't see the need to go into here as if you see them you will know exactly what I mean.EV Training (Effort Values) has become much simpler this time around, you don't have to guess and check what your Pokemon's EV points are. To make along story short, EV points are how the game determines what stat bonuses a Pokemon gains. In all previous games EV points were given only by defeating Pokemon , each Pokemon gives different values. In this game, you can still do that, but you can also use training mini-games on the touch screen to raise it manually. These can get repetitive but it is a fantastic way to make sure your Pokemon get's the points in the stats you want them to be in. I spent an hour filling out my ZigZagoons speed and Attack stats so I knew it would gain the most in those 2 areas as he leveled. If you mess up or don't like how it turned out, you can actually reset EVs now using a specific item. It's been simplified for the best In my opinion as now everyone can take advantage of the EV system and in a much nicer visual way.I wanted to throw this little addition in there, for the first time in pokemon history you more or less get free movement. No longer are you permanently tied to a Grid format. Once you get the Roller Blades (About 1 hour into the game) you are able to move in full 3D movement with the joystick, you can still move in a grid format on the D-pad for precise movement. You are still limited to the grid inside of Pokemon Centers and houses, but so far that's all it's been limited too. I love this, it's a simple change but lord do I love it. Just another Quality of Life mechanic they put in.The Pokemon Aime system looked odd to me at first. It was more or less Nintendogs with Pokemon (sort of). And I kind of ignored it to begin with, But I did give it a try a little bit later and while yes it is still just a way to view and... well pet and feed your Pokemon it's also got hidden bonuses. The first is obvious, the more you pet and play with them the quicker their happiness grows. There are some Pokemon Like Riolu that will only evolve if they are happy enough. The secondary effect is it also grants another form of EXP boost. As you play and feed them their heart meter grows, granting a bonus to EXP gained as you battle, similar to if you had traded them from another trainer. I didn't learn about this until later but now that I know about it, I take time out of my farming to play with my Pokemon a bit, at least the ones I like!The last and certainly not least, new addition is the Mega Evolutions. It's a simple concept really, take an old favorite Pokemon like Mewtwo, Charizard, Blastoise etc... give them a special stone, and press a button on your magical we promise this has nothing what so ever to do with Digimon bracelets, and poof. You get a new Mega Evolution Pokemon! More or less a 4th form for some. Now these are super powerful Pokemon that can really dish out some damage, but only lasts for the one battle, and on top of that you can only have one in your party (or something like that) I am not actually far enough in the game to be able to comment much more on this, but I had to mention that it's there and I am kinda excited to try it out later.All in all, the gameplay is top notch and Fantastic.Music/Sounds 9/10I have always liked Pokemon music, this just seemed to take it to a new level. The only issue I have is that the 3DS/3DSXL's speakers don't give it justice, I hooked the system up to a speaker system in my apartment and then the music came to life, in fact more than I expected. Eery song was fantastic and fit the scene well the battle music is quick and gives an odd sense of urgency, the forest music was somewhat dark and mysterious and the town songs are nice and upbeat. My favorite song thus far is the Gym battle music which... I can't even describe but it's awesome!The sound effects are also as good as ever. Each Pokemon has their own unique Cry (Noise they make) and all Pokemon from previous games have had theirs enhanced to match the quality of the new ones. I noticed this first with Linoone as he is my favorite Pokemon so I noticed his Cry had changed since I've used him in every Pokemon game since he was introduced in Sapphire/Ruby. The battle sound effects also fit the attacks and meld perfectly in with the attack. I can hear that rock throw hitting my Linoone, and it sounds... heavy.My only minor complaint is that they didn't use the Pokemon's voices like the TV show does. The only Pokemon in the game that does is Pikachu, and I really think that they could have just made it that much better had they had all of them sound like they do in the show. It's a minor complaint but there it is!The New PokemonI didn't give this a rating because it's pure opinion, but I haven't found anything wrong with the new Pokemon. They keep coming up with some pretty awesome Ideas of new Pokemon to add... and yes some not so awesome ideas. (I don't' think I will ever forgive them for the Garbage Bag Pokemon from Black/White). I've encountered a Pokemon based on the Robin, A Panda, I've ever seen a Sword Pokemon (Ghost type). Heck my favorite Pokemon is based on a badger. All have their own personalities and it shows during combat and in the Pokemon-Aime thing. It's all a matter of what you like and what you don't like.Graphics 10/10Ok, the biggest update the game has received is to it's graphics. Up to this point, Pokemon games have been nothing but Sprites and sometimes a little movement. All your characters, sprites. All the Pokemon, slightly moving in combat sprites. They didn't have a life of their own, it felt somewhat empty... but no longer.This game, looks, FANTASTIC. One of the best looking games on the 3DS, and it doesn't suffer from poor framerate. I didn't quite realize how much effort they put into the Pokemon's Models until I started battling with them. Every Pokemon past and present has been redone with a 3D model, and I couldn't be happier. Anyone who has played any of the Pokemon stadium games will be familiar with how they look, but now we have them in the Pokemon game! Each Pokemon has their own movements and animations which is even more amazing to me. Take ZigZagoon and Linoone for example. ZigZagoon is known for moving in a ZigZag pattern, so when it attacks it does just that, running left, then right, then left, then attacking. Due to irony, when it evolves it no longer runs in zigzag patterns, it runs in a straight line but is unable to turn easily, so it's attack is no longer a zigzag, it's a straight dash at the opponent, then a jump backwards. This is just one of many examples of each Pokemon's different movements. Attacks also have their own looks and animations, some look better than others but that is to be expected. Now will they look as good as they do when fighting in the show? No, they still for the most part stay in their own battle &#34;Circles&#34; but they just look so much better when fighting I love it, I can't complain at all about it. I really can't praise the game's graphics enough... they took their time with it.Outside of battle, the game still looks amazing, the grass and tall grass still look like they used to and in a tile format, but your character and the other characters all have nice 3D models, even if you don't see them all in combat. You can change your characters clothes, get a little customization there but sadly it's limited to just a few different outfits. I suppose it's better than nothing though!Multiplayer 10/10Lets talk Multi-player. A lot of us as kids got this game and loved to trade and battle with each other, trying to have the better team, etc... But it has always been restricted in many ways. until the DS games came out, internet battling never happened. And even on the DS versions it was still limited and somewhat sluggish. Black/White added the GTS (Global Trade System) why became a great way to obtain hard to find Pokemon, or Pokemon from previous entries in the series you just didn't have the ability to get. But it was still a tad bothersome as you had to go to a specific location, or go to the Pokemon centers to activate these features.NOT ANYMORE!Pokemon X/Y said screw all that moving around, you can battle, Trade, etc... On the go! you wanna trade with a friend? Tap on his avatar on the bottom screen and say &#34;hey I wanna trade&#34; same with battling. If they accept POOF. You trade/battle right then and there. You can even do this for random passer-bys. On the bottom screen will be a constantly updating list of other random players you can challenge to battles or trade with.That not enough for ya? The GTS Is also here, and available world wide. Search for a Pokemon you want to trade for, and it will bring up a list of players that have put that Pokemon up for trade, and what they want in return. You can deposit one of your own, and ask for another Pokemon. For instance say I want a Zangoose, I can deposit a Seviper into the GTS and say &#34;I will trade this for a Zangoose&#34; if someone accepts it the trade occurs and you can pick up the Pokemon later. That's the best part about this, you don't have to sit and wait. It's all done even if your game is turned off. You merely have to check up on it later! you also don't have to Have the Pokemon on you to trade, trading anywhere allows you to access your Storage Bank of Pokemon and trade from there, this is a new feature and one i welcome with wide open arms.This time around they added 2 new features to the Multiplayer!The first is Wonder Trade. This is an... interesting New one. You trade one of your Pokemon , any one ya want, to another random person. You don't know what you are going to get until the trade is completed. And you can do this infinitely. You will probably get a lot of junk Pokemon , but I have already received some things I didn't expect. I got an Eevee, and a wierd other Pokemon I had never seen before. Along with like 3 Caterpies. But still, it's random fun. And each time you use an interaction like Wonder Trade, Trade, Battle... you gain PokeMiles which can be traded for useful items at a vendor in the main city.The other thing they added is O-powers. these are short term buffs you can give yourself or other players. Things like &#34;raise Attack, Raise Defense, Increase Capture Rate, etc...&#34; They last about 3 minutes (at least at level 1) and can be sued as long as you have.. O points I guess they are called. you recover the Points as time passes, using the ability in yourself costs the full point value and using it on a friend or other player costs 1/2 the value. It's just a fun way to help others or yourself out.Final Score:I give Pokemon X/Y, 9 Linoones and a Zigzagoon (9.5) out of 10.It's not perfect, but damn it's close. This is the Pokemon game that I have always wanted ever since the original Pokemon Stadium came out, showing off the Pokemon in 3D. I am a little sad that there isn't a version on the Console, I'm sure they will still make the Stadium U game, but Those only deal with combat, this is the whole game and I adore it. My only complaints I have are really the same complaints I have had from the start of Pokemon's Existence. I hate HMs. Always have, always will.If you are New to the Pokemon series, this is probably the best to start on, even if the start is a bit rough for new players. (They don't explain a heck of a lot it just assumes you know some things by now). But it's also the best in the entire series for experienced and casual returning players alike.
Wii Fit U is the sequel to Wii Fit and Wii Fit Plus, and is playable only on the Wii U. While the game is downloadable on the Nintendo eShop, there may be reasons you want a physical version of the game; perhaps you want to save storage space on your Wii U, to not keep your Wii U constantly connected to the Internet, to be able to bring the game to play at family and friends' houses, or perhaps you just want the green version of the Fit Meter that comes with it. In these cases, you'll be able to purchase this version of the game with a physical disc and a Fit Meter (For those who don't have a balance board yet, you'll want to purchase the bundle with the Balance Board here:Wii Fit U w/Wii Balance Board accessory and Fit Meter - Wii U).The Wii Fit U opening screen starts with same familiar logo and music from Wii fit and Wii Fit Plus. The system will let you copy over any old data from Wii Fit or Wii Fit Plus either through a full System Transfer (a long and rather painful process), or by copying your old data from your Wii onto an SD card. Once I did this I was able to see my old Mii and select it for use.As with Wii Fit, an animated Balance Board will be your host, welcoming you back and explaining the new features of Wii Fit U. First, it explains there are new training modes that have been designed for the Wii U GamePad. Next, it explains that the Wii U GamePad can be used as a personal display, so the TV can be turned off for certain activities, such as the Body Test.The initial Body Test works very much like it did in the original Wii Fit in terms of tracking how your weight and center of balance change over time. One clever new feature is that you have the option of taking photos of your face each time you do the Body Test using the GamePad camera. It'll store the image of your face and you can see how your face changes over time (it'll be displayed in the calendar along with your BMI and Center of Gravity). Photos are saved for three months, but the first photo you take each month is saved for five years so it's a clever way for you to visually keep track of the progression of your weight loss through your face.You then proceed with the Body Test. You'll hold the GamePad in your hands throughout the test, but the weight of the GamePad will be subtracted from your results. As with the old Wii Fit, you test your Center of Balance by standing on the Balance Board as straight as you can. The difference this time is that you're holding the GamePad at eye level, so you have to stand up straight while keeping your face centered on the screen in a frame. As with the original Wii Fit, you'll then see a plot of how balanced you are when you stand. If you're off balance, you'll get advice on how to correct it and the benefits of doing so. They've added some new balance tests that make further use of the Wii U GamePad; in one of them you use the GamePad to "track" a moving ball as it floats in front of you, all while the system is tracking your balance.Next you'll see your BMI (or optionally, your weight). As with the old Wii Fit, you see a colored bar telling you in you're underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese, and your Mii will grow chubbier or thinner depending (sadly, mine got a bit rounder over the last few years).After all this is done, you get your Wii Fit Age, "stamp" your progress into the calendar, and proceed to the main menu.The main menu is called "Wii Fit Plaza". You can select or create new profiles, play the game as a guest, or play multi-player games (unfortunately, since there's only one Balance Board, you have to take turns with these games, there's no way to play them simultaneously nor compete online). Assuming you have a Fit Meter associated with the profile, each time you select the profile you'll be asked to sync it to collect all your offline activity.The Main Menu seems a bit busy at first, but you'll get used to it in time. It's divided into a couple areas:1) A series of windows scrolling across the top of the page will allow you to:- View a monthly calendar of your progress- View graphs of your progress- Register or read more about the Fit Meter- View an album of "snapshots" taken of your Mii during gameplay- View a Notice Board of events that have occured in the game, such as unlocking features, new players being added, and so on.The main options include:2) Body Test - this allows you to take (or re-take) the Body Test3) The Balance Board - when there's an exclamation point over the Balance Board it means he has a message for you. The little guy is full of interesting tips (you'll learn all you ever wanted to know about METs, or Metabolic EquivalenTS, for example).4) User Settings - clicking on your Mii will let you adjust your height, birthdate, calendar stamp design, trainer (creepy male dude or the creepy female dudette from Wii Fit who's slightly less creepy than she was before), outfit, privacy settings (whether you want pictures taken or a password to be entered to access your profile), and even when the date should change over to the next day (either 12 AM or 3 AM for those who work out after midnight).5) Fit Meter - you can click on the Fit meter to learn more about it or to register your Fit Meter (and unlock the trial).6) Training - this is the "meat" of the game where you can access all the training activities.When you click on Training, the menu has these options:A) "Select Exercise" will let you choose an individual activity to exercise to. For each exercise, you'll see the number of METs expended, as well as the number of times you've done the exercise and whether the Balance Board is required. The categories of activities are the same as in Wii Fit Plus, with addition of a new "Dance" category. The activities consist of some old exercises that have been carried over from Wii Fit and Wii Fit Plus, as well as some brand new ones.The categories are:i) Yoga (18 activities): here, you basically follow an on-screen trainer and mimic him or her in various yoga activities. These are mostly the same Yoga exercises from the original Wii Fit, including deep breathing, half-moon, warrior, tree, sun salutation, standing knee, palm tree, chair, triangle, downward-facing dog, dance, cobra, bridge, spinal twist, and shoulder stand. In addition, there are three new activities: spine extension, gate, and grounded V.ii) Strength Training (15 activities): As with the original Wii Fit, these exercises are meant for strengthening specific parts of your body. Again, you follow an on-screen trainer and again, these are mostly the same strength training activities from Wii Fit. They include single leg extension, push-up and side plank, torso twists, jackknife, lunge, rowing squat, single-leg twist, sideways leg lift, plank, tricep extension, arm-and-leg lift, and single-arm stand. The three new activities are balance bridge, side lunge, and single-leg reach.iii) Aerobics (15 activities): These are exercises that promote aerobic activity. They include a number of the same games from Wii Fit, including hula hoop, super hula hoop, basic step, advanced step, free step, rhythm boxing, basic run, two-person run, free run, island cycling, and driving range. Most of these games are the same as before, but many have interesting enhancements. For example, on the Hula Hoop, you can now twirl hoops not just with your waist but with your wrists as well with the Wii Remote Plus. On Island Cycling, the graphics are much improved, and as you "bike" you can see a beautiful day turn to a beautiful sunset and then turn into a starry evening, reminiscent of Walk It Out. Many of these activities also have a new "extra" mode that provides an additional level of challenge beyond the original.In addition, they have four brand new Aerobics activities. (BTW, I've provided descriptions of all the new activities here; if you want to read about the old activities that have been ported over, you can check out my review onWii Fit Plusfrom five years ago).- Puzzle Squash - here, you use both the Wii Remote Plus and the Balance Board. You basically have to use the Wii Remote to hit a squash ball, and "walk" on the Balance Board to get your player to move to the right position in a sort of 3D version of "Breakout". It's a simple concept and fairly easy to master, but also surprisingly addictive.- Free Boxing - this uses the Balance Board, the Wii Remote Plus, and either the nunchuk or another Wii Remote Plus. This game is a lot like the Rhythm Boxing game except you're using both your hands and your feet to punch in certain patterns.- Orienteering - this one is like the basic run, in that you're travelling through Wii Fit Island. The difference is that you're not using the Balance Board or the Wii Remote Plus, but you're holding the GamePad in your hands.  As you walk in place, the accelerometer and gyroscope in the GamePad can detect that you're moving and if you're turning to the left or right, and your Mii will respond accordingly. It's a "hide and seek" type game where you're walking around the island looking for Miis whose photos you see on your GamePad. You need to remember your surroundings and different faces, but you can always ask a random Mii for help too.- Rowing Crew - This one uses the Balance Board and a Wii Remote Plus. You can either site on a chair and put your feet on the Balance Board or (as I prefer), sit right on the Balance Board. You then grasp your Wii Remote with both hands, and make a rowing motion by bending your body up and down almost as if you're doing sit-ups. You need to use the right technique-row to the cadence that your coxswain is setting, match your fellow crew members, and make sure your oar is out of the water when you're not rowing by rotating the Wii remote the right way. You can see a first-person view on your GamePad and a side view on your TV. This one is hilarious-when you don't row properly to the rhythm all your fellow rowers in your boat look back at you and give you dirty looks. But once you get the hang of it it feels remarkably authentic-and gives you a great aerobic workout.iv) Dance (8 activities): I wasn't sure what to expect with this one. The first thing to know is that this is isn't a clone of Just Dance or Zumba Fitness. Rather, it's a simplistic but still pretty clever set of step aerobics exercises that actually come close to simulating the basics of actual dance moves. You work out with the Balance Board and two Wii Remote Pluses, and basically have to move your arms and feet to match the trainer. There's a wide variety of music with unique "moves" that let you work out different parts of your body. Hula music lets you relax, jazzy music helps you work your waist and thighs, hip-hop music lets you work out your thighs, locking let you work out your upper arms, flamenco lets you work out your arms and legs, salsa lets you work out your shoulders and back, and burning beats gives you a calorie burning challenge. The first time you run through the dance the instructor will give you an explanation of the moves, but then after that you can dance all you want.v) Balance Games (18 activities): In every version of Wii Fit, this has always been the section of the game that's the most fun, and it's true with this game as well. Returning are old favorites from the original Wii Fit like Soccer Heading, Ski Jump, Table Tilt, Rhythm Kung Fu, Ski Slalom, Perfect 10, Snowball Fight, Obstacle Course, Tilt City, Balance Bubble, Bird's Eye Bulls-Eye. But they have a number of fun new games as well. As with Wii Fit, there's a Beginner level and an Advanced level to unlock for each activity. And as before you're not necessarily going to get a very strenuous workout from these games; they're more designed to help you improve your balance and coordination vs. provide you strength or aerobic training. And they're a blast to play with friends and family.The new Balance Games include:- Trampoline Target - This is a fun one that uses the Balance Board where you're jumping on a trampoline. The only problem is, you still can't actually jump on the Balance Board, so you have to bend and then extend your legs at the right time, and then when you're in the air you need to shift your weight to "steer" yourself back over the target in the middle of the trampoline. The more accurate you are with your "jumps" and your targeting, the higher your next jump will be. Like a lot of the others, this activity makes great use of the GamePad by showing you a top-down view on the GamePad and a side view on the TV. This one is a whole lot of fun, and works your legs, hips and overall balance, but it takes a while to get used to not actually jumping (as with earlier versions of Wii Fit, if you do accidentally jump the game clears your progress and resets to the beginning). I give this a 4 out of 5 for fun, and a 4 out of 5 for exercise.- Hosedown - This one uses the GamePad and the Balance Board. You hold the GamePad in front of you and point it at the TV. Miis will throw mud balls at you and you have to hose them down with water. You press one foot down on the Balance Board to spray the water, lift your foot off the Board to refill your water tank, and use the GamePad to aim and shoot at specific targets, while the TV has a wide angle view of the scene. I get the sense this one doesn't really give very much exercise (1 out of 5), but it's so fun (5 out of 5) it doesn't really matter.- Dessert Course - This game is pure genius. You're a waiter in a crowded restaurant who has to collect desserts from the chefs situated in the corners of the room and deliver them to people standing and waving you down throughout the room. You hold your GamePad flat like a tray (balancing your desserts on it), walk in place on the Balance Board, and "steer" by rotating your tray like a horizontal steering wheel. You see a first-person view of the room on the TV-and a first-person view of the desserts on your tray on the GamePad (which look delicious)! As you advance in the game, you start getting all kinds of desserts, from jelly rolls and round cream puffs that roll off your tray to jiggling cups of pudding and have to try to deliver them without bumping into your guests. This one is probably a 3 out of 5 for exercise, but easily a 5 out of 5 for fun.- Ultimate Obstacle Course - I think back in the day I described the Wii Fit obstacle course as sort of a "3D Super Mario Bros", and wrote that I wished it could be longer and have more variety. Happily, this game delivers on that. As with the original version of this game, you walk in place on the Balance Board and try to avoid obstacles like giant rolling balls and falling off cliffs. Something new is the ability to "turn" by turning your feet on the Balance Board while walking in place, admittedly something it took me a while to get used to, with with enough practice I finally figured it out. This one is a 4 out of 5 for exercise (mainly because you'll be playing it over and over until you get it right). As for fun, it's a bit frustrating at first as you try to figure out the "turn in place" thing, but once you do it's a ton of fun. A nice bonus is that your Wii Gamepad displays an overhead map of the course.- Core Luge - This is another of those really cool simulations that almost feels like the real thing. You sit on the balance board and just like a real luger, you start out on the course by pushing off with your hands to get some speed, and then lean back and navigate the luge course by moving your butt. Exercise value is about a 2 (you really don't work out your core as much as you'd hope), but fun value is a 4 or a 5.- Scuba Search - This is a treasure hunt game that uses the Balance Board and the GamePad where you're a diver searching for different kinds of fish and treasure. You can see a first-person view on the GamePad, and a map of the entire area on the TV. You basically shift the weight on your legs to make your diver swim, and you can bend and straighten your knees to make him zip forward. This one reminded me a little of Endless Ocean for the Wii. It has a lot of replay value because you're always wanting to go back and find the fish or the treasure you missed. I give it a 3 for exercise value and a 4 for fun.- Climbing - This is a rock climbing game that uses the Balance Board and two Wii Remote Pluses. You use the Wii remotes to grab towards the rocks (pressing A to grip them), and use walk in place on the Balance Board to climb. Technique and speed are important: you need to grab onto small (red) or medium (blue) rocks with one hand, and large (green) rocks with two hands, keeping your balance the whole time just like in real life. 3 for exercise value, 5 for fun.Other options under "Training" include the following:B) Personal Trainer will let you input a certain goal (for example, calories you'd like to burn in a workout session, amount of exercise time, type of exercise, and activity level), and will put together a custom workout for you pulling together different activities and exercises.C) Wii Fit U Routines are collections of routines (made up of three specially selected activities each) that are designed to help you work out specific goals, such as easing tension in your shoulders and back, relaxing, trimming your waistline, improving your posture, and even helping with your digestion and circulation.D) My Routine allows you to put together your own custom workouts based on your favorite activities.E) Ranking shows you statistics of how many times you've played each activity, which activities you've played most recently, and the total amount of calories burned and time spent playing each activity.F) Finally, there's a Group option that lets you select a group to work out with. You'll be able to view the group's statistics and leaderboards as a way to further incentivize you to work out.There are substantial improvements in the Wii U version of the game:- For Yoga and Strength Training, unlike with previous versions of the game, you can choose either a male or female trainer. The female trainer has gotten a bit of a makeover-she has a little more color and definition than before doesn't look at pale and ghostly as she once did. They're done an amazing job with the trainer's animation so you can see exactly what the proper form is from any angle. You can use the GamePad or Wii remote's arrow buttons to get a 360 degree view of the trainer from any angle, and use the 1 and 2 buttons (or X and Y buttons) to zoom in and out to get a close-up view.- For Yoga, Strength Training, and Dance, there's a new feature called "mirror mode" that lets you see an actual video image of yourself next to the trainer. This one is a little tricky to set up-you definitely need a GamePad stand, and you need to put it in just the right place, preferably about 5 or more feet away from you (obviously, you'll need to do the navigating with a Wii remote instead of the GamePad). Once you get it set up right, you can see a real-time video of yourself next to the Wii Fit U trainer, and you can match his or her moves precisely. The system doesn't attempt to use video to judge if you're using the right form, but you can easily eyeball whether you're doing the moves correctly or not.- You can press the "-" button to swap the action between your Wii GamePad and the TV. This way, if you or someone wants to watch TV, you can continue your exercise unabated.- After you finish an individual exercise you'll get a recommendation of which one to do next.- As I've mentioned the game makes great use of the GamePad to provide a new dimension (literally) to many of the activities. It adds a lot more depth to the games to be able to view the action from multiple angles.- Your "piggy bank" of calories and time expended in the lower right-hand corner has a personality now and will change colors and hop around as you progress in the game.- I like how there's an option to switch players without having to restart the game, for situations at parties or family gatherings where you want to take turns playing. Speaking of taking turns playing, there's also an option on the main menu to load up certain games where users can compete against each other by taking turns. I would have liked to see them support multiple balance boards for head-to-head action, but it looks like that's just something they're going to support.As for negatives, I have to admit there aren't many. I do have the same gripe with Wii Fit U that I had with Wii Fit, that many of the activities (even the aerobics and strength training ones) are so short they don't really get your heart pumping at an elevated rate at a vigorous or even a moderate intensity zone. But then again if you string enough activities together and do them in a rapid-fire you can certainly get close. My other gripe is about the GamePad battery-it runs out way too fast, especially when you're trying to use it as your main screen, so you basically have to keep it plugged in most of the time.All in all, Wii Fit U gets a solid 5 out of 5 stars from me. It's that good. It takes all the best things from the original Wii Fit and Wii Fit Plus, but also adds a lot of enhancements and new features that take full advantage of the Wii U. For example, graphics are faster and cleaner, and the GamePad isn't just a gimmick like it is in some other games-they did a great job of using it to really enhance the enjoyment of the game. There are enough new activities to make the game feel fresh and new, and yet they kept enough of the old to keep it familiar. And the games are easy to learn, but have great replay value as well, something great for workouts or friendly competition between family and friends.Would I go so far as to say that if you don't have a Wii U, that this game is so good that you should run out and get one? It really depends. If you're just looking at the Wii U solely for fitness gaming, there are a growing number of alternatives out there such as the Xbox One's Xbox Fitness service (which "gamifies" old exercise videos), products such asGoji Play) which let you turn your iPhone or iPad into an exergaming system, and of course a ton of fitness trackers from the likes of FitBit, Nike, and Jawbone that let you track daily activity. Each of these has their strengths and weaknesses.That said, if you're already considering the Wii U because you to play some of the excellent first-party games that have recently been released such as The Legend of Zelda, Pikmin 3, or Super Mario 3D World (or upcoming games like Mario Kart 8 or Super Smash Bros), I'd say Wii Fit U is definitely a title that would put me over the edge. Many of the new fitness activities are a ton of fun just to play as games, the Wii Fit Meter makes a viable alternative to the more expensive FitBit or Nike Fuel for tracking daily activity, and for all of its recent struggles, Nintendo is still the one to beat for the humor, creativity, and originality in their games.

Excelente juego. Es muy diferente a cualquier juego de v&iacute;deo. Obliga a pensar y a moverse, dos cosas que en los v&iacute;deo juegos son muy escasas. los gr&aacute;ficos son simples, pero no se necesita mas. la m&uacute;sica es muy adictiva y divertida. Claro esta que uno no aguanta jugar por horas este juego, pero si lo anima a jugar un poco todos los d&iacute;as para seguir avanzando y eso es muy bueno con los ni&ntilde;os que normalmente se quedan pegados a un juego por horas.
Este no es el juego tradicional de mover el control. Este es el juego de mover el cerebro y luego mover el control. Muy sencillo, muy divertido y permite jugar en familia. Tiene muchas opciones y es muy divertido. Mis hijos y yo lo jugamos juntos todo el tiempo y me gusta por que no me aburre y no los aburre a ellos.

GENERAL OVERVIEW: &#8220;The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds&#8221; is the first top down Zelda game since the 2005's Gameboy Advance title, &#8220;The Minish Cap&#8221;.  This game is also  first new handheld title in the Zelda franchise that Nintendo has released for one of their flagship products, the 3DS.  The game is a direct sequel to the 1991 SNES title, &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221;, which is one of the most highly acclaimed games in Nintendo&#8217;s bountiful back catalogue, featuring all new dungeons.Make no mistake.  &#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; is the best Zelda game since &#8220;Ocarina of Time&#8221; or, barring that, &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221; itself.  For longtime Zelda players, &#8220;Link Between Worlds&#8221; may first initially lull you with its emotionally powerful, highly nostalgic rendering of Hyrule circa 1992, only to discover how deeply Nintendo is rearranging the Zelda template.  &#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; casts off series conventions (while still retaining its identity as a Zelda title).To compare notes with another franchise,  Hideo Kojima is radically restructuring the inherent design of the Metal Gear universe by making &#8220;Metal Gear Solid 5&#34; an open world game rather than a tightly controlled stealth game.  In order to ease players into the radical shift and new reinvention of Metal Gear&#8217;s signature stealth play, as adapted for an open world environment, Konami is releasing &#8220;Ground Zero&#8221;, which is a prologue to the main game, as a separate, introductory primer for &#8220;Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain&#8221;.&#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; is a reshuffling of the deck, a &#8220;Ground Zero&#8221; if you will for Zelda.  Unlike the Metal Gear comparison, this game isn&#8217;t about charting new territory though - it&#8217;s about returning to the very roots that made the series so special in the first place. Before we get into the ramifications and what this game may mean for Zelda in general, here are some pros and cons.PROS:Link navigating via merging into walls as a painting is both highly imagitive and drastically opens up new ways of solving puzzles and transvering Hyrule, breathing much needed life into Zelda's [intellectual side] cerebral side.Excellent level design  almost goes without saying.  Nintendo has always excelled at level design.-No farming for items.  All usable items are manna-based, with a meter that regenerates over time.  You never have to worry about running out of bombs or arrows again!  (We so needed that in the original 1987 Zelda!-Mini-games, including baseball (!!!) and chicken dodging-Has a dual world setup (Hyrule and Lorule), like the original SNES game.NEUTRAL:-Borrows the overworld map of its SNES predecessor almost to the pixel.  For veterans of the series, this borrowing will be highly nostalgic, though others may complain they are just rehashing &#8220;Link to the Past&#8221;.  One benefit of using the same map is that it helps provide continuity for a series renowned for how disconnected each game appears in relation to others.  (In 2011, Nintendo finally published an official timeline in &#8220;Hyrule Historia&#8221;.  Guess what!  There are THREE SEPARATE OFFICIAL TIME LINES, and all three branch off from &#8220;Ocarina of Time&#8221;.)-The story is pretty simple.  While some may think that detracts from the overall experience, I am fine with a simplified story.  Nintendo has never been about story, and when they do get tangled into in-depth story-telling, you end up with three timelines and soap opera disasters like &#8220;Metroid: Other M&#8221; which by the end you lose almost all respect for Samus.  There&#8217;s a reason why they keep narrative out of Mario games (though to be fair, the Mario RPGs have some good stories).CONS:-Visually feels little more than an upgrade to &#8220;Link to the Past&#8221;, rather than a distinct artistic style.-The Overworld, while expansive in 1991, feels a little small by today&#8217;s standards.-Lorule (as opposed to Hyrule) just sounds like an idiotic linguist pun.  This is just a minor personal complaint though.THE MORE PROBLEMATIC ELEMENTS OF MODERN ZELDA:  It&#8217;s not a secret to everybody (to lightly misquote a certain Mobin) that Zelda has grown increasingly stagnant in recent years.&#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221; is by far the most devise of the mainstream &#8220;Zelda&#8221; installments, even more so than initial responses to the art style of &#8220;Wind Waker&#8221; circa 2003.  The more flawed elements of that game are all game design decisions that became codified in the sacrosanct &#8220;Ocarina of Time&#8221; and over the years finally met their logical conclusion in &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221;.Eiji Anouma, the main overseer of the series, has even stated in post &#8216;Skyward Sword&#8217; interviews that Nintendo is rethinking Zelda conventions in order to keep the series fresh and relevant due to lackluster response by players to recent titles.Tevis Thompson has written a great, lengthy essay regarding the issues he believes is plaguing modern Zelda games.  (The title is &#8220;Zelda Just Keeps Getting Worse. But It Isn't Beyond Saving&#8221;.  It is well worth reading).  Thompson is discussing &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221;, the 2011 Wii game.  &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221; is by far the most devise of the mainstream &#8220;Zelda&#8221; installments, even more so than &#8220;Wind Waker&#8221;.  While far too long to address Thompson point by point for an Amazon review, the essential summary of his complaints are three fold:1.  Zelda has gone from a vast, overworld experience to an increasingly narrowed, mechanical by rote design, rather than organic gameplay which invites multiple methods of play.  Key quote: &#8220;Modern Zeldas do not offer worlds. They offer elaborate contraptions reskinned with a nature theme, a giant nest of interconnected locks.&#8221;  Thompson describes &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221; as a culmination of &#8220;reducing the world into a series of bottlenecks&#8221;.  In other worlds, Zelda games have become so mechanical in nature that they have lot their sense of wonder and adventure and even (or perhaps especially) danger.  The worlds also feel empty, a complaint I first voiced against &#8220;Ocarina of Time&#8221;.  For all the grandeur of &#8220;Hyrule Field&#8221;, save for some Stalfos knights that appear after sunset and an occasional Peahat or too, it&#8217;s a pretty empty field.  The sky in Skyward Sword is also notoriously void of any real exploratory content worth mentioning.2.  Lack of Difficulty.  The two NES Zelda games (especially &#8220;The Adventure of Link&#8221;) can be brutal at times. Beginning with &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221;, the difficulty of the Zelda franchise has been on a steep downward slope.  Saturo Iwata, Nintendo&#8217;s President, has directly addressed this decrease in difficulty in Nintendo products.3.  No respect for the player.  By design of bottle-neck environmental roadblocks (first heavily featured in &#8220;Zelda II&#8221;* and culminating in &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221;), greatly reduced difficulty, and extemly intrusive &#8220;journey companions&#8221; that hold your hand every step of the way, Zelda feels more like a guided tour of Hyrule than a daring adventure with real danger at every turn.  The puzzle elements have been greatly minimized due to constant direction.RESTORING ADVENTURE TO ZELDA: &#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; largely addresses Thompson&#8217;s concerns.  These are the practical, concrete game play mechanics in which A Link Between Worlds&#8221; is reinvigorating Zelda.-Death has consequences.  When renting your items, you are able to keep said items for as long as you stay alive.  However, if you die you lose your items.-Challenge: Directly ties to the first point.  The overworld isn&#8217;t the grandiose, but almost entirely devoid of enemies, Hyrule Field.  Instead, there are well armored foes intent on killing Link and LOTS OF THEM.  Likewise, the dungeon bosses are more difficult than we&#8217;ve seen in a long time.  They take skill and cunning to beat as well as figuring out how to best exploit their weak spot.  The dungeon enemies themselves are no pushover either.-Enemies are used as boundary markers.  From Thompson&#8217;s essay: &#8220;Link must be allowed to enter areas he's not ready for. He must be allowed to be defeated, not blocked, by the world and its inhabitants.&#8221;  You can get into some areas that will push you to your max to escape alive, let alone in stunning victory.-&#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; returns to the open world feel of the original NES title, albeit in the confines of Hyrule as shown in &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221;. Due to renting items, dungeons are largely (but not entirely) completeable in any order, rather than a pre-defined set path that must be followed at all costs.-Item renting restores some of the wonder and adventure to the series, because this time around you are truly interested in the contents of treasure chests, knowing that they will hold something other than series trope items such as boomerangs, bows, etc.-Fast Travelling: If you find yourself without necessary items for a dungeon, you can quickly get to the shop to get said item via warp points without excessive backtracking.-No more &#8220;Hey, Listen!&#8221;  For the first time in years, Link is on his own, left to figure out what he must do without constant rejoinders from the game helper of the week.  To compensate, if you need assistance there is the very unintrusive Hint Glasses which are mentioned briefly and then never forced upon the player, or visiting fortune tellers, which is entirely at the player&#8217;s discretion.  Just like the statue in the 1st palace of the Dark World where you must shoot an arrow in its eye to proceed or the backtracking in the Ice Palace, there will be moments you are left puzzling what to do.WHAT &#8220;A LINK BETWEEN WORLDS&#8221; MEANS FOR THE ZELDA FRANCHISE: There are two main camps in Zelda Fandom: those who think &#8220;Ocarina of Time&#8221; is the best and those who think &#8220;Link to the Past&#8221; is best.  While predictions are a dangerous venture at the best of times, &#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; clearly indicates that Nintendo is not above radically rewriting conventions for one of its most successful IPs, returning them to earlier times.  To return to the Metal Gear comparison with &#8220;Ground Zero&#8221;, &#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; is laying the groundwork for the still unnamed (at the time of writing) Wii U Zelda game which we know is in development.Appropriately enough for a series with three time lines, developmentally and in game design &#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; has effectively ignored the last twenty years of its own franchise. Nintendo has returned to the original ethos and game philosophy of the first Zelda titles and have created an alternate point of development in which Aonuma has indicated he is fully intent upon pursuing. Anouma has confessed to never completing the original Zelda title and wanting to never make a game like that.  Before this game, this attitude would explain why there is such a disconnect between the recent games and the trail-blazing originals.When the game was first pitched to Miyamoto (before it was a &#8220;Link to the Past&#8221; sequel or even featured the painting), he declined, saying that it &#34;sounds like an idea that's 20 years old!&#8221;.  While the context is not exactly the same, Anouma and his team are finally returning to the hallmarks of Zelda that so captivated us in the first place (at least, gamers of my generation), returning to the older ideas of the series.&#8220;A Link Between Worlds&#8221; is a course correction LONG OVER DUE, and if this game is any clear indication, not only have Anouma and his team learned from their mistakes with &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221;, but are going all the way back to the very foundational elements of the series before &#8220;Ocarina&#8221;.Aonuma has stated based on user feed back (now so readifuly plentiful via the Internet and Miiverse) that the new Wii U Zelda game will focus much more on the open-world feel so pioneered by the original NES classic that has been largely untouched by the series since then.  Games such as the The Elder Scrolls and the Grand Theft Autos are more closely kin to the original &#8220;Zelda&#8221; than &#8220;Skyward Sword&#8221;  If Anouma is to be believed, then the Wii U Zelda will be a reinvention of modern 3D Zelda titles.  If Nintendo follows the direction established in &#8220;Link Between Worlds&#8221;, then the Wii U Zelda will be a grand reinvention indeed!While Miyamoto is ultimately responsible for Zelda, the last fifteen years have largely been spearheaded by Anouma, and for the first time I feel that we are seeing how Nintendo would develop the series based on the original four games.  We are returning to Miyamoto&#8217;s original vision for the series at long last!.......*Whereas almost the entirety of Hyrule in &#8220;The Legend of Zelda&#8221; is open to the player, in each successive game the ability to explore became increasingly more and more confined either by necessity of the plot or that to progess to Dungeon 2, you must have an item from Dungeon 1, etc.  Thompson points to &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221; as the starting point of this mechanical trend in Zelda games (&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s a wall with weird rocks.  Use a bomb.&#8221;), which is not wholly accurate.  While minimally present in the original NES game, &#8220;Zelda II&#8221; is the first game that really locked you into a defined order of dungeons and locked off worlds.  While &#8216;Link to the Past&#8217;&#8216;s Dark World dungeons are tremendously flexible in the order in which you complete them in &#8220;A Link to the Past&#8221;, there is absolutely no possible way for extensive sequence-breaking in &#8220;Zelda II&#8221;.  Want to go to the Island Palace?  You have to have the Faerie Spell, which can only be obtained by use of the hammer.  Want to go to Maze Palace?  Have to have the Raft from the Island Palace in order to cross over into eastern Hyrule.  Want to go to the Sea Palace?  Have to have the boots from the Maze Palace.  To get into Three Rock Palace (or even access the southern portion of Hyrule in which that palace is located), you have to have the Flute from the Sea Palace to get by the River Devil guarding the bridge.
Ok I am continuing my reviews for The Zelda games I own cause I don't own every Zelda game. This Zelda game is without a doubt favorite Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past Which for any of those who don't know was suppose to be called Zelda III The Triforce Saga. But since The NES was near the end of it's life span Nintendo decided to go for The SNES. If any game deserves the title of Zelda III cause I think of the 1st 2 Zelda games on The NES & A Link To The Past as a Triforce Saga. Now after Zelda II wasn't what everybody wanted even though I didn't mind it they decided to go back to an overhead view & drop The RPG elements go back to using Rupee's & weapons instead of using all magic attacks. If I could give this game all the stars in the world I would if I am a fanboy for this game then color me a fanboy. I played this game a lot along with Mario All Stars & Street Fighter II Turbo back in the day. Even now hearing about all the glitches & preforming them this game is feels fresh & this game is 21 years old. This game brings a lot to the table like the tone which would be used in Ocarina Of Time & big time in Majora's Mask as well for Twilight Princess. This game started the dark tone in a Zelda games. You have this character Aghnim he not only collects the money from The King for helping him he then kills The King & takes these Maidens that are ancestors to The Wise Men he seals them into The Dark World. The Dark World is the land where The Triforce is at people who go to The Dark World don't come back & they change shape. It's a twisted version of Hyrule. Link is framed by Aghnim a kid gets sick from the evil air coming from Death Mountain. You have this kid who plays the flute who is dead. The next reviews I do for The Zelda games will go more in depth this game was released in Japan in 1991 & a few months later in The Spring of 92 The name of this game in Japan is The Legend Of Zelda The Triforce Of The Gods. The story is Ganon tries to get his hands on The Triforce he enters The Golden Land The King has 7 Wise Men put a seal on the enterance to The Golden Land which it seems that he's been sealed there forever. Hundreds of years later a drought a famine & illnesses have spread through Hyrule The King thought it had something to do with The Golden Land but the seal was intact a Wizard or a Satanic Priest however you want to look at I prefer what Aghnim was in The Japanese version. Aghnim shows up & ends the problems with Hyrule, The King was looking for decendents of The 7 Wise Men Aghnim helped him find them then he got a big role in The Kingdom Aghnim's intentions came clear he murdered The King Of Hyrule put a mind control spell on The Guards had The Maidens rounded up & sent them to The Dark World which this is all told in the opening & it really showed off the power of The SNES plus that music by Koji Kondo is great which ALTTP is my favorite Zelda score Ocarina Of Time is 2nd the opening music where it shows Aghnim sending The Madiens to The Dark World scared me as a kid.[...]Princess Zelda is locked up she sends out a telepathic message 1 of the people who get it is Link & this is not The same Link from the 1st 2 games & this is not the Zelda you save from the 1st game or the sleeping Zelda from part II. Link's Uncle decides he's going to see what that Aghnim guy is up to he tells Link not to leave the house. Well he does anyway you head for The Castle & find a secret passageway where you find your Uncle has been badly injured he gives you his sword & shield he never finish'e his sentence & there is a lot of debate about what he wants to say he says Princess Zelda is your a lot people say he is going to say your Sister. Link might have a connection to The Royal Family cause in the novel his father was a knight but Zelda being his sister I doubt it. So the 1st thing you have to do is save Zelda & get her to this Church so she can be hid. You have to find 3 Pendants that will allow you to get The Master Sword this game introduces The Master Sword. You'll have a few side quests to get items you need to get to each dungeon or will help you complete it The Light World Dungeon music is another track that scared me as a kid[...]Also Aghnim has framed you for kidnapping Princess Zelda when you get The Master Sword Guards have taken Zelda killed The Priest so you have to head into the area of the castle where you weren't allowed to enter before cause The Master Sword can break the seal. Aghnim makes you watch as he sends Zelda to The Dark World. When you face Aghnim you can't fight him head on you have to play Dead Man's Volley as it's called. When he's beat Aghnim draws you into The Dark World & if you have The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera then you won't change shape into a bunny. Going back can be a hassle. This man you meet before the 1st Light World Dungeon Sahasrahla contacts you telepathically & that you have to free all The Maidens & Zelda & that is the only way defeating Aghnim & Ganon. The Dark World has no human's everyone has been turned into a beast or some kind of animal that represents what's in their mind & heart. It might be best to try to upgrade your weapons whenever you can like you shield & you can upgrade The Master Sword when you save this Blacksmith who is trapped in The Dark World. You can get a powerful Golden Sword near the end. The Boomerange can be powered up to reach further when you keep throwing in rupee's to summon a Great Fairy. I like how you can increase the number of arrows & bombs you can carry. The Silver Arrow's return too mainly to defeat Ganon. Other items you need is like from The Desert Temple The Power Glove that allows you to pick up heavy rocks. In the 4th dark world dungeon you get The Titan's Mitt that let's you pick up even heavier rocks & stones. I mentioned you must get The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera cause it allows you to keep your human form in The Dark World. Another must have item to even get to the 2nd temple is The Pegasus Boots that Sahasrahla. that let's you move faster & you have to use them to knock The Book Of Madora off a book shelf in Kakariko Village which that book is the only way you can enter The Desert Temple. The 3 Medallions you get are very handy. The items you get in The Dark World such as the hammer in the 1st Dark World dungeon The Hookshot in the 2nd Dark World Dungeon. The Fire Rod in The Forest Temple in The Dark World. The Titan's Mitt mentioned about already in the 4th Dark World dungeon. Then in the 5th Dark World dungeon you get The Blue Mail that reduces the amount of damage you take. The 6th Dark World dungeon contains The Cane Of Somaria that create these blocks that can weigh switches down it can also get create a block that can get you to the other side of the room like in Turtle Rock. Also in Turtle Rock you get The Mirror Shield. In Ganon's Tower you obtain The Red Mail which reduces the amount of damage you take even more. Basically you need all the items to complete the game such as The Ice Rod, Zora Flippers, The Magic Cape, Cane Byrna. There are a couple of side quests that stand out in my mind like the 1 where you get the flute there is this old man & his grandson is missing there is this boy that looks similar to Link & anytime you approach him he disappears it's cause he's dead. In The Dark World you find this animal or whatever it is standing on a tree stump you find out that is Flute Boy cause he went to The Dark World & was killed. With this flute you now have access to a bird that will fly you place to place & this lost old man in the caves leading to Death Mountain & he gives you the mirror that can take you back to The Light World. This game is 1 of the 1st times I believe that Nintendo allowed death in their games. So the game started a dark tone in Zelda games. I mentioned the glitches & how they made this game feels fresh I tried them out there kind of funny like you can face Aghnim while you have Zelda with you & Aghnim is sending Zelda to The Dark World it's like you got Zelda out of her cell so who is Ganon sending to The Dark World. Plus you know it's night time when you start the game & it's raining well if you do the glitch where you beat the game in like 5 minutes then in the ending it's night time & it's still raining. My favorite glitch is where you have the mirror & The Moon Peral ok & you can keep going back & forth from The Light World to The Dark World near the broken bridge & you can explore The Dark World before you even face Aghnim the 1st time. Just make sure you have the mirror, The Moon Peral & The Master Sword. Stuff you have to figure out like how to get The Big Key or the item in each dungeon is great. The bosses were all good The Ball & Chain Trooper who is in the castle. To The Armos Knights which a lot of fun. The boss of The Desert Temple Twinmola it's a good pattern type boss. The Tower Of Hera Moldorm is annoying cause if it knocks you off the ledge then you got to fight the boss all over again. The 1st Aghnim fight is good cause you have to knock it's attacks back at him. The Dark World dungeon bosses are well done some are harder than others such as Arrghus, Mothela, The Blind Thief & Trinexx. The 1st Dark World dungeon boss isn't too hard Helmasaur King you just use your hammer bust away at the metal on his face & fire arrows at the middle of it's head. In The 2nd Dark World Dungeon you battle Arrghus who is a big eyeball surrounded by several small eyes which you have to use The Hookshot to pull the eyes away & slash away with The Master Sword until you have to fight the giant eye. Mothula in The 3rd Dark World Dungeon while difficult all you need is The Fire Rod to beat it. The Blind Thief is hard cause it has 2 or 3 heads attacking you. In The 5th Dark World dungeon you face Kholdstare which is kind of a pain. You also have to have the bird to get to The 6th Dark World dungeon & the boss is Vitreous who is sort of like Arrghus but not as hard. To get into Turtle Rock you have to have The Quake Medallion & to get through it you have to have The Cane Of Somaria. This dungeon is a big pain cause you have to light torches to open some doors & if 1 torch goes out then the door will close. The boss Trinexx in it's 1st phase where you use The Fire & Ice Rod's isn't hard when you fight in it's 2nd phase then it's more of a challenge & I recommend that you get plenty of red or blue potion or some fairies on hand for The Dark World dungeon bosses. When you beat The 7 Dark World dungeon youu free a Maiden & finally Princess Zelda. Which takes you to Ganon's Tower where you fight the 3 Light World dungeon bosses again & have the 2nd & final encounter with Aghnim. Which the 2nd battle with Agahnim is a little bit harder. The final boss is Ganon & Ganon is the hardest of any Zelda game cause it takes 4 Silver Arrow's this time instead of 1 & when stomps the floor the ends start to break off & if you're knocked off the ledge you have to start the battle all over again. I think A Link To The Past Ganon is harder than Ganon in The NES original or Ocarina Of Time. But when you beat Ganon you are treated to a great ending. I know this has been a long read & I said my next reviews for The Zelda games are going to be really long so just a warning. This game is amazing bottom line while love Ocarina Of Time & enjoyed Majora's Mask & Twilight Princess this still remains my favorite Zelda game. If you never played Legend Of Zelda A Ling To The Past you should & play it any way you can cause you will miss out on 1 of the best games of the 90's
Ok I am continuing my reviews for The Zelda games I own cause I don't own every Zelda game. This Zelda game is without a doubt favorite Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past Which for any of those who don't know was suppose to be called Zelda III The Triforce Saga. But since The NES was near the end of it's life span Nintendo decided to go for The SNES. If any game deserves the title of Zelda III cause I think of the 1st 2 Zelda games on The NES & A Link To The Past as a Triforce Saga. Now after Zelda II wasn't what everybody wanted even though I didn't mind it they decided to go back to an overhead view & drop The RPG elements go back to using Rupee's & weapons instead of using all magic attacks. If I could give this game all the stars in the world I would if I am a fanboy for this game then color me a fanboy. I played this game a lot along with Mario All Stars & Street Fighter II Turbo back in the day. Even now hearing about all the glitches & preforming them this game is feels fresh & this game is 21 years old. This game brings a lot to the table like the tone which would be used in Ocarina Of Time & big time in Majora's Mask as well for Twilight Princess. This game started the dark tone in a Zelda games. You have this character Aghnim he not only collects the money from The King for helping him he then kills The King & takes these Maidens that are ancestors to The Wise Men he seals them into The Dark World. The Dark World is the land where The Triforce is at people who go to The Dark World don't come back & they change shape. It's a twisted version of Hyrule. Link is framed by Aghnim a kid gets sick from the evil air coming from Death Mountain. You have this kid who plays the flute who is dead. The next reviews I do for The Zelda games will go more in depth this game was released in Japan in 1991 & a few months later in The Spring of 92 The name of this game in Japan is The Legend Of Zelda The Triforce Of The Gods. The story is Ganon tries to get his hands on The Triforce he enters The Golden Land The King has 7 Wise Men put a seal on the enterance to The Golden Land which it seems that he's been sealed there forever. Hundreds of years later a drought a famine & illnesses have spread through Hyrule The King thought it had something to do with The Golden Land but the seal was intact a Wizard or a Satanic Priest however you want to look at I prefer what Aghnim was in The Japanese version. Aghnim shows up & ends the problems with Hyrule, The King was looking for decendents of The 7 Wise Men Aghnim helped him find them then he got a big role in The Kingdom Aghnim's intentions came clear he murdered The King Of Hyrule put a mind control spell on The Guards had The Maidens rounded up & sent them to The Dark World which this is all told in the opening & it really showed off the power of The SNES plus that music by Koji Kondo is great which ALTTP is my favorite Zelda score Ocarina Of Time is 2nd the opening music where it shows Aghnim sending The Madiens to The Dark World scared me as a kid.[...]Princess Zelda is locked up she sends out a telepathic message 1 of the people who get it is Link & this is not The same Link from the 1st 2 games & this is not the Zelda you save from the 1st game or the sleeping Zelda from part II. Link's Uncle decides he's going to see what that Aghnim guy is up to he tells Link not to leave the house. Well he does anyway you head for The Castle & find a secret passageway where you find your Uncle has been badly injured he gives you his sword & shield he never finish'e his sentence & there is a lot of debate about what he wants to say he says Princess Zelda is your a lot people say he is going to say your Sister. Link might have a connection to The Royal Family cause in the novel his father was a knight but Zelda being his sister I doubt it. So the 1st thing you have to do is save Zelda & get her to this Church so she can be hid. You have to find 3 Pendants that will allow you to get The Master Sword this game introduces The Master Sword. You'll have a few side quests to get items you need to get to each dungeon or will help you complete it The Light World Dungeon music is another track that scared me as a kid[...]Also Aghnim has framed you for kidnapping Princess Zelda when you get The Master Sword Guards have taken Zelda killed The Priest so you have to head into the area of the castle where you weren't allowed to enter before cause The Master Sword can break the seal. Aghnim makes you watch as he sends Zelda to The Dark World. When you face Aghnim you can't fight him head on you have to play Dead Man's Volley as it's called. When he's beat Aghnim draws you into The Dark World & if you have The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera then you won't change shape into a bunny. Going back can be a hassle. This man you meet before the 1st Light World Dungeon Sahasrahla contacts you telepathically & that you have to free all The Maidens & Zelda & that is the only way defeating Aghnim & Ganon. The Dark World has no human's everyone has been turned into a beast or some kind of animal that represents what's in their mind & heart. It might be best to try to upgrade your weapons whenever you can like you shield & you can upgrade The Master Sword when you save this Blacksmith who is trapped in The Dark World. You can get a powerful Golden Sword near the end. The Boomerange can be powered up to reach further when you keep throwing in rupee's to summon a Great Fairy. I like how you can increase the number of arrows & bombs you can carry. The Silver Arrow's return too mainly to defeat Ganon.

Then in the 5th Dark World dungeon you get The Blue Mail that reduces the amount of damage you take. The 6th Dark World dungeon contains The Cane Of Somaria that create these blocks that can weigh switches down it can also get create a block that can get you to the other side of the room like in Turtle Rock.

This game is amazing bottom line while love Ocarina Of Time & enjoyed Majora's Mask & Twilight Princess this still remains my favorite Zelda game.

Welcome to this, this is another review for The Zelda games that I own & as you can see it's a review for The Legend Of Zelda Majora's Mask. While not as epic as Ocarina Of Time this game does so much right that it does come close. Also forgive me if this review sounds more like walkthrough I said in my Ocarina Of Time review that when you get to 7 years later when Ganondorf takes over I mentioned it has a dark tone. In Majora's Mask it has a dark tone from start to finish. This game came out in the year 2000. The story is takes place I don't know how long after Ocarina of Time when Link was sent back to live out his childhood he lost from Ganondorf Link is out looking for Navi who left him at the end of OOT. Skull Kid who I didn't mind in Ocarina Of Time in this game I hate him I know he's under Majora's influence but he still stole the mask from The Happy Mask Salesman which lead to all the evil things going on. You start off with Link who is blindsided by 2 fairy's Tatl & Teal who are Skull Kid's fairy's. Skull Kid steals The Ocarina Of Time which Princess Zelda gave him he steals Link's Horse Epona he turns Link into a Deku Scrub Sapling. Which the little Deku Scrub Sapling contains the spirit of Deku Scrub Child. Tatl gets gets left behind Teal is all alone with Skull Kid you follow the path that Skull Kid took & you meet up with the only character besides Link from Ocarina Of Time The Happy Mask Salesman. He asks for your help to get Majora's Mask from The Skull Kid cause he tells how that mask contains pure evil & he can help you return to normal if you get your ocarina back. You head into this place called Termina you have only 3 days to complete what you need to do & you'll see why cause there is a giant angry looking moon in the sky & it's going to blow Termina off the face of The Earth so yeah there people in town worried about it some want to leave others want to stay cause they think nothing will happen. There is an event that's going to happen called The Carnival Of Time in 3 days. So you have some exploring to do like you need to help The Great Fairy cause she has been broken apart by Skull Kid & you have to find The Stray Fairy to put her back together where she will give the ability to fire bubbles. Now the guards in Clock Town will not allow to leave cause your a Deku Scrub Sapling all of about 4 or 5 years old your not properly armed & they wonder where your parents are at. In the east side of Clock Town you can get to Termina Field using a glitch. You can also try to join The Bombers Gang a group of kids that like to help people in need. You can go to The Astral Observatory when you learn the code from The Bomber's where you can get a Moon's Tear that you can give to an Adult Deku Scrub & he will give you a land title deed for his flower. You can use that to fly up to The Clock Tower during the last 5 hours of the final day. You can get your ocarina back & play the song of time where it takes you back to the start of the 1st day. The Happy Mask Salesman will teach The Song Of Healing that will turn you back to normal & leave a Deku Mask behind that you'll need to use in the 1st dungeon. When Link tells The Happy Mask Salesman that he didn't get Majora's Mask from The Skull  Kid he becomes The Angry Mask Salesman & I can see why people think he's creepy when gives you an angry look. As a human you can now join The Bomber's Gang cause they wouldn't let Deku Scrub Sapling Link join cause Skull Kid was in their group & he didn't work out. You get The Bomber's Notebook. You then have to take on 4 temples in a swamp, in the mountains, in an ocean & in a canyon. You head off to Woodfall where The Deku Royal Family live there's a member of the family missing & that's The Deku Princess The Deku King is mad is going to punish this monkey that was seen leaving The Woodfall Temple. You have to sneak around in your Deku Scrub Sapling form you have to sneak past the guards & get to the area where the monkey is at I do hate the part where you have glide with The Deku Flowers to each platform. You find out The Deku Princess was captured at Woodfall Temple & it is a good starter temple & you get The Bow & Arrow you have a couple of ok sub bosses & a decent boss. For every temple you beat you free 1 of the 4 giants the boss Odolwa provides a pretty good challenge. The bosses weren't as hard as Ocarina Of Time or A Link To The Past or the 1st 2 games. There is 1 boss I don't need a real strategy to beat that I will talk about. You save The Deku Princess after beating The Woodfall Temple take her to The Deku Palace she's mad at her father for punishing the monkey. If you want to do something mean spirited then watch the monkey being dipped boiling hot water it leaves the monkey unresponsive. This game can be emotionally dark. As a Deku Scrub Sapling you can race The Deku Butler & when you catch up to him he tells you that you remind him of his son. At the beginning of the game you find this dead Deku Toddler that was killed at the hands of Skull Kid. I liked The Deku in this game they weren't just standard enemies in this game. The Goron's in this game look the same except for The Goron Elder & his Son which is a baby Goron that won't stop crying cause his Dad's gone. The Lens Of Truth returns you can see Darmai's ghost & you get The Goron Mask obtaining The Lens Of Truth can be a pain. Now Darmani was a sort of leader for The Goron's he was killed in Snowhead trying to figure out they're having a long winter casue they're going to freeze to death if they don't stop it. To get The Transformation Mask you need to have The Song Of Healing & play to free their soul. Which The Goron Mask contains Darmani's soul & when you're wearing it The Goron's all think you're Darmani. The Snowhead Temple is solid cause it has a hard sub boss challenging puzzles & Ghot is 1 of the more interesting bosses in a Zelda game & the funniest of the game. Also in Snowhead Temple you The Fire Arrow enhancement. Side quests are well done I like The Romani Ranch side quest where you help Romani & Cremia. You meet this little girl named Romani who asks your help to kill these ghosts or aliens or whatever they are from stealing their cows. Cause every year around this time "they" as she calls them steal their cows which is their source of income cause their milk goes to Mr Barton & his Milk Bar in Clock Town. Cremia Romani's Older Sister  owns the ranch after her father died. I care about these characters & what happens to them. If you beat Snowhead Temple spring comes to the mountains & you can obtain a powder keg that can blow up the giant boulder blocking Romani Ranch & if you get there on the 1st day you can get Epona back but on the 2nd or 3rd day you can't get Epona back. Cause on the 2nd day Romani will be walking around the ranch a look of confusion & will be unresponsive. On the 2nd night she will be asleep in her bed. Also on the 2nd day Cremaia will be in the barn with a depressed look like she's going to cry she's wondering why she didn't listen to her sister & she's all worried about her. Plus all their cows are gone. At night Cremia is sitting at the dinner table even more depressed & looking like she's near suicide. On the 3rd day Cremia is still in the barn depressed. Romani will be stilling on a box all messed up it's hard to explain I don't know wtf those aliens ghosts or whatever they are did to her cause on the night of the 1st day she was abducted by "them". Anyway this side quest is a must to complete you can just play The Reverse Song Of Time that slows the current of time & give you plenty of time to help Romani & is also useful in temples too & you can get done whatever you need to do in a reasonable amount of time. If you have protected the ranch Romani will give you a bottle with Romani Milk. Bottles are also a must have item you also get another bottle early on in Southern Swamp when you help Koume & Kotake cause in this game they're good. Getting back to Romani Ranch on the 2nd day everything is fine Cremia can now deliver milk to Clock Town it's kind of sad Romani can't go to Clock Town when you know Link & Romani kind of helped save the cows. The Night Of The 2nd day you can help Cremia by defending the wagon against 2 masked men who try to break the milk bottles. If you manage to hold them off then Cremia will give Romani's Mask which allows you to get into The Milk Bar & buy milk including Chateau Romani which gives you unlimited magic for the full 3 day cycle. On the night of the 3rd day Romani & Cremia will be in the barn Romani tells you that she get to drink Chateau Romani it's her 1st time cause Cremia acknowledge's her as an adult. She also tells Romani to sleep with her tonight cause Cremia knows that this will be their last night. Another thing is the people causing all the problems & grief on the ranch is 2pe  do  p  h  i  l  e's named The Gorman Brothers. I mean on the 3rd day if you fail to protect the ranch they incriminate themselves mentioning what happened at Romani Ranch. So I shudder to think what they did to Romani. The 3rd temple is in Great Bay & there are a group of Zora's who are The Terminaian counter part cause Hylians have a Terminaian counter part like Romani is a reused character model of Malon as a little girl & Cremia is a reused character model of an adult Malon. Except for a few original models like The Goron Elder, Darmani & The Goron Elder's Son. The Deku Royal Family is all original too. These Zora are part of a band called The Indigo Go's there is this girl named Lulu who has lost her voice a group of Gerudo's have stolen her eggs. For 1 why do they want The Zora Eggs for breakfast or to use on their missions. You have this Zora out of the ocean & to dry land he was injured & left for dead by The Gerudo Pirates his name is Mikau using The Song Of Healing you can get The Zora Mask & you head off to find the 7 eggs 4 of which are at The Pirates Fortress. These Gerudo's are more prone to kill unlike their Ocarina Of Time counter parts. I also got The Stone Mask early so most enemies can't see you & you'll have no problem getting the eggs If you're able to get all 4 eggs then you take them to The Laboratory. The other 3 eggs are at Pennaicle Rock & with the help of a Sea Horse it will guide you there you'll have to face 3 Deep Sea Pythons. If you get the 3 remaining eggs then you can take them to The Laboratory & you'll learn The Ballad Of The Wind Fish play it Lulu she'll get her voice back & head to The Water Temple. I didn't care for the water temple in Ocarina Of Time I didn't mind it in Majora's Mask it's my least favorite. Gyrog is the worst boss ever in a Zelda game. There no strategy in beating it all you do is shoot it with an arrow turn into a Zora use an electrical barrier on it & I am horrible in Zora form so I just get chewed up by Gyrog & lose health. The other 2 bosses Odwalla atleast you needed a strategy to defeat it & Ghot was interesting  & a fun boss. You get The Ice Arrow's in this temple which you freeze enemies with the sub bosses were pretty good though especially the 1 that was a throwback to A Link To The Past. Oh yeah if you want another mean spirited thing you can do is take Lulu's Eggs & in West Clock Town you can take them & sell them at The Curiousity Shop I did that 1 time & I felt like a real pos for doing it. Next is 1 of the weirdest areas in the game The Ikana Canyon where you also have a side quest in the graveyard where Dampe is at he's not the same Dampe from OOT in The Ikana Graveyard you can get The Captains Hat & you can order around Stalchildren. There is this emotional side quest with this girl named Pamela her Dad has been infected & is cursed & is part Gibdo. You can play The Song Of Healing to turn him back to normal the cut scene afterwards is well done. In Ikana Castle you get The Mirror Shield which looks pretty bad & you learn The Elegy Of Emptiness which leaves statues of yourself if you play it in human form then you have a weird statue of human Link which is nick named Ben because of this story called Ben Drowned which is a story in itself. Stone Tower Temple is a puzzle in itself cause of all the flipping you have to do to the dungeon. You also get another enhancement for your arrows The Light Arrows. The Wizrobes return as a sub boss in this dungeon although they do throw in original sub bosses here & there. The boss is like a throwback to Twinmold from A Link To The Past. If you get The Giants Mask it evens the fight up but you can only use for this boss only. Stone Tower Temple is ok. The sub boss The Garo Master is hard & I have easier time fighting Iron Knuckles. You can go on & face Majora since you have awakened all 4 giants I like to have all the masks so I do 1 of the most attention grabbing side quests The Anju & Kafei side quest that goes the full 3 day cycle. You help Madame Aroma find Kafei who is her Son. Kafei is going to marry this woman named Anju who runs The Stock Pot Inn at 1:50 the 1st day you get a room key & if show her Kafei's Mask then then she'll ask for your help you have to deliver a letter she wrote to Kakei at 3 in the afternoon the 2nd day you meet Kafei he tells you that Skull Kid turned him into a kid & Sakon a real pos stole his Sun Mask cause he & Anju were going to exchange masks the night before The Carnival. On The 3rd day The Curousity Shop Owner has been taking care of Kafei he tells you he's waiting for Sakon at his hideout you have to help Kafei get through the security system where The Sun Mask is on a convayer belt being taken down to where Sakon is at I guess. If you manage to get to it before the mask falls into the hole then Anju & Kafei will reunite on during the final hours then I go on & face Majora. However if you fail Kafei is stuck & I shudder to think what Sakon is going to do to him. Anyway when they reunite it's a really nice cut scene & you'll get The Couples Mask which means you're a witness to it. When you go into The Clock Tower you play The Oath To Order where Majora loses his grip on Skull Kid you then go into The Moon it's very unsettling with the tree & The Moon Children who want masks & you play hide & seek you have to deal with 4 dungeon themed rooms. Each Moon Child wears a mask that represents the boss of that temple. You have to give up all your non transformational masks. If you have all the masks then you'll be able to do that & will get The Fierce Deity Mask it makes the final battle with Majora easy & with that Termina is saved from doom all is right in the world & Link goes back to Hyrule Termina celebrates The Carnival Of Time. This game does so much right from the tone to the characters a pretty good item selection decent dungeons really good side quests decent bosses a with the overall message. So a really good follow up to Ocarina Of Time & if you've not played Ocarina Of Time or Majora's Mask you're missing out on 2 of the best Nintendo 64 games ever.
Here I am with the last of my reviews for The Zelda games I own I finally played this game recently I even bought a Gamecube so I could play this game I have to say this is a sequel that Ocarina Of Time & Majora's Mask deserves & for whatever reason I prefer the darker Zelda games. It's not dark in the way Majora's Mask I would say this is more of a menacing dark than emotional like OOT or MM. How this game came about was Ocarina Of Time & Majora's Mask were big hits I have never got to play The Wind Waker I know a lot of people hate that game I have seen playthroughs of it looks like an entertaining & it does get a lot of love from what I read. Twilight Princess gets hated on a lot so it's just what you prefer. Zelda Twilight Princess released in November 2006 & was a launch game for The Wii & a month later was released for The Gamecube. Also at E 3 in 2004 they showed a trailer for this game it got a hugely positive response. You'll have to forgive me if this does come off as a walkthrough The story is set hundreds of years after Ocarina Of Time & Majora's Mask there is this man named Zant who has met Ganondorf & Zant wants to go after the people of Hyrule Ganondorf agrees since he wants revenge against the people of Hyrule cause The King found out about Ganondorf's coup & he was found guilty of treason & has been trapped in The Twilight Realm ever since. So he stores his power in Zant whatever Zant wants Ganondorf wants whatever Ganondorf wants Zant will desire so he takes over The Twilight Realm turns Queen Minda into an imp. Zant goes to Hyrule goes to Hyrule Castle where he & these Twili Creatures easily take down the guards he tells Princess Zelda that he will kill everybody in Hyrule if she doesn't surrender her throne. She does it only to protect her people Zant covers Hyrule in darkness & everybody is a shadow spirit. So you're introduced to Link who is a related to The Link from OOT & Majora's Mask. He lives in this village similar to Kokiri Forest called Ordon he lives there & works on a ranch there & you start off as an adult. I guess Link is a popular guy in Ordon some of the kids in the neighborhood want Link to buy them a Slingshot. You're introduced to a character Ilia who is Link's childhood friend when you get around to buying The Slingshot you get a Wooden Sword from Rusl which you just try out the different moves you can do with it Link is a friend of Rusl & his family that include's Rusl's Wife Uli who is pregnant & their son Colin who looks up to Link & Ilia. These group of kids Talo, Beth & Malo want Link's help to chase after this monkey so Link's Horse Epona can be used to follow them & Epona is 1 of the most have things in this game cause Hyrule Field is bigger than The Hyrule Field in Ocarina Of Time or Termina Field in Majora's Mask. Anyway you have to save Talo & the monkey you find out he isn't a bad guy. The next day Link is going to deliver a sword to Hyrule Castle but Ilia is mad cause Epona has a cut on her leg. So you have to talk to her she tells you how she overreacted but then a group of monsters led by King Bublin riding bores come in knock Link out take Ilia & all the kids in Ordon Village Link comes to & he goes up to this portal where he is dragged through & Hyrule is covered in darkness & Link is turned into a wolf & he's locked up in Hyrule Castle. Minda sees what's going on & she breaks Link free where you have to find Princess Zelda she tells you that Zant took over & tells you how you're the chosen 1 cause Link is related to The Hero Of Time. You go back to Ordon Village where you use your wolf skills & obtain The Ordon Shield which is a wooden shield but later on you'll be able to buy a Hylian Shield made of metal. & You get a real sword The Ordon Sword. In each area that is covered in darkness you need fill kill 16 bugs called Twilight Parisite's that leave behind Tears Of Light it clears the area of darkness & returns you to normal. Then you can go to The Forest Temple which it does remind me of being inside The Great Deku Tree not saying it's the remains of The Great Deku Tree it is a great way to learn who the temples work in this game. You have some good enemies, decent puzzles & the boss was ok. You'll go on to Kakariko Village that has been covered in Twilight other places like Lake Hylia, Zora's Domain & Castle Town have been covered in it too. You find out that Beth, Malo, Talo & Colin are being taken care of by a man named Renardo & this man naed Barnes. You have to find The Tears Of Light & return Kakariko Village to normal. There the kids are happy you saved them & then you have to go to Goron Village & find out why they're so hostile to the people of Kakariko Village now this 1 Goron won't let you through & will knock you off the cliff. Rendardo tells you that Mayor Bo from Link's hometown was Sumo Wrestler & beat The Goron's. You get Epona back which makes going through Hyrule Field faster. You go back to Ordon Mayor Bo teaches you the skills to beat The Goron's & he gives you a pair of Iron Boots & this time The Iron Boots are more useful than in Ocarina Of Time. When you get back to Kakariko Village King Bublin comes through it looks like he's going to trample Beth but Colin knocks her out of the way so he is taken by King Bublin & since you have Epona you can chase after him they finally got Horse Combat done right they really wanted to do it in Ocarina Of Time & Majora's Mask but in those games you could hardly use a bow while riding Epona so Horse Combat is pretty good for once. The part where you knock King Bublin off the bridge I get lucky with this battle but when you knock King Bublin off the bridge you can head on to Death Mountain & you get a good cut scene with Colin where he tells you that he understands what it means now to be strong. With The Goron Boots you can now just throw Goron's to the side & get to their area where they live you have to face Gor Coron in a Sumo Wrestling Match & he will allow you to go into The Goron Mines. The reason they have been hostile to humans is cause their leader Darbus has been turned into a monster named Fryus. The Goron's have different looks to them they just don't look alike.  Before you do that you need to go to The Malo Mart & buy a0 Hylian Shield. BTW Malo is like 2 or 3 years old & he's smart in economics. Goron Mines is a great dungeon the puzzles are pretty good there is a fun sub boss & you get The Bow & Arrow. I also though it was good how you had 3 pieces of a key to form The Big Key. Fryus made for a fun boss. The Iron Boots come into play with this boss.  I failed to mention that you're going around collecting these pieces of a mask to create The Fused Shadow. After Goron Mines you have to free Castle Town, Lake Hylia & Zora's Domain from Twilight. Also Barnes opens up his Bomb Shop you can finally purchase Bomb's & a cool thing about this is you can combine your bombs with arrows & when you fire an arrow at whatever you want it explodes on impact. When you head off & enter an area that is covered in darkness you'll turn into a wolf again but as a wolf you'll have a better sense of smell & you can find out where Ilia is at in Castle Town you find where Ilia is at she is being watched by a woman named Telma who runs a bar & they're tending to an injured Zora Boy. Then you go & collect The Tears Of Light to turn back to normal & clear the area of darkness. You help The Zora by dropping a molten stone in the middle of Zora's Domain to melt the ice. After you turn back into your human form you get to witness a disturbing cut scene. Then you help Telma get the injured Zora boy to Karariko Village you also find out that Ilia has amnesia Horseback Combat comes into play again it's easier to knock King Bublin off the bridge this time cause you just shoot him with a couple of arrows. Then you have guess what? A Water Temple but it's better than what was in Ocarina Of Time or Majora's Mask. Plus the puzzles were pretty good a decent mini boss The Zora Tunic & Iron Boots come into play as well you get a Clawshot which is a very useful item. The Boss Morpheel isn't as bad as Morpha which they both have similar names only Morpheel isn't as hard as Morpha. When you beat Morpheel you'll have all 3 pieces of The Fused Shadow. After that Zant blindsides you turns Link into a wolf permanently injure's Minda & Zant takes The Fused Shadow & this was probably the best cut scene of the entire game although most of the cut scenes were very good in this game. You have to get to Hyrule Castle to get Zelda's help & the music track in this part was very good. Telma's Cat helps you cause in wolf form you can talk to various animals. You can go through this secret passageway where you meet this man named Jovani & his cat they have been turned into gold you have to collect The Poe Souls where you kill a Poe in wolf form. Anyway Zelda helps the injured Minda & tells you have to get The Master Sword to break the curse & return to normal. You have to go deep into Faron Woods where The Master Sword is in The Sacred Grove. Your run into a character that was in Ocarina Of Time & Majora's Mask Skull Kid I don't know if it's the same 1 chances are it is cause on his flute he's playing Saria's Song. He's trying to kill but it's all a fun game to him. So yeah I didn't like Skull Kid in this game either he was tolerable in OOT though. Anyway you get to The Sacred Grove you have to move these 2 statues around which is a really good puzzle to get access to the remains of The Temple Of Time & obtain The Master Sword & their is no more use for The Ordon Sword. I would've liked it if they would included getting The Mirror Shield later on in the game. Now you can transform into a wolf or human anytime you want & you can warp to area's that have a portal. At Telma's Bar you are introduced to a group of fighters trying to stop Zant consisting of Ashei, Auru, Shad & Rusl. Here you can find out where each temple you needed to go at is located. You have to go to The Gerudo Desert & find The Mirror Chamber to go to The Twilight Realm. There are no more Gerudo's. Anyway you have to go to this fortress where you fight a lot of enemies & have a 1 on 1 showdown with King Bublin. Combat has been greatly improved & the best on The 3D Zelda games I have played also you learn hidden skills from The Hero's Shade like The Back Slice, Helm Splitter & The Ending Blow. The Desert Temple I thought was really good the boss is fun it has challenging pattern. The mini boss was good. Stallord is 1 of the best bosses in The 3D Zelda games. Plus I liked how you had to avoid being pulled in by The Quicksand Pits. The Big Poes add a little more fun too. The Spinner is unique. When you head to The Mirror Chamber there is 3 pieces of the mirror missing your also treated to a cut scene where you see how Ganondorf lived through his execution. You find out the other 3 mirror pieces are in Snowpeak Ruins, Faron Woods & The City In The Sky. You get a side quest that involves that Zora boy who we find out is Prince Ralis this has a decent amount of emotion when Zora's Domain was frozen Queen Rutela told Ralis to go to Hyrule Castle & inform Princess Zelda what's going on. He was inured & left for dead by Zant he has gotten better but he doesn't have any confidence in himself & feels worthless. It helps you find where your next area you have to go to & you are introduced to 2 Yeti's Yeta & Yeto. They have the 2nd piece of the mirror you have Yeta who is sick & Yeto who is making soup you have to look for the bedroom key & the 1st time you a pumpkin in a treasure chest the 2nd time you find Goat Cheese I don't know why those things would be in a treasure chest. The weapon you get in this temple is The Ball & Chain which is a big help in defeating the annoying ice enemies. It is also needed to beat the boss of Snowpeak Ruins who turns out to be Yeta when she looks into the mirro she turns into Blizzeta. This boss was pretty fun to fight. I have to say Yeto is sort of annoying anytime he has something he wants he doesn't ask for it he shoves you on your a  s  s for it. Also you can race against Yeta & Yeto after completing the temple. The Yeta race is hard but it is fun knocking her out of the way with The Master Sword. But the important thing is if you win you get a heart piece which I always recommend that you get as many heart pieces as you can to build up you life. I got 19 out of 20 hearts filled up. Of course a temple I love that they put in this game was The Temple Of Time. The Puzzles were neat. But before you get there you have to go through Faron Woods again & Skull Kid wants to play that game where he wants to kill you. In The Sacred Forest Meadow you can open the door to The Temple Of Time with The Master Sword & go back to The Temple Of Time's original state. I liked how you had to move this statue around & move it's original space you have to get The Dominion Rod to do that. You have to fight a Dark Nut to get The Dominion Rod which the fights with The Dark Nuts feel more like 1 on 1 battles than what they were in OOT & MM. I mean controlling the states is kind of cool plus you can use it to smash the baby Gohma & The Young Gohma. It was also fun taking them down with Bomb Arrows. The boss Armagohma is more like a spider than Queen Gohma but it's way too easy all you do is shoot it's eye with an arrow & smash it's stomach commanding a statue. I do feel the bosses were a little too easy in this game. There is a side quest to regain Ilia's memory & you have to go into this hidden village where you take down these Bublin's & this old lady named Impaz gives you this Horse Call & you play it in front of Ilia you get a great cut scene where she regains her memory. Also if you go back to the hidden village Impaz will give you a book with missing pages Shad tries to study it but nothing happens your Dominion Rod is powered up & find the missing pages which will help you remove the statue in the cellar under Rendardo's house. You find this canon that that will launch you into The City In The Sky now these strange bird creatures called Ooccoo live there & you run into these things in most of the dungeons they are helpful cause they can warp you out of the dungeon if you need to restock your weapons or regain health then you can warp back to the point you left at. Anyway this dragon named Argarok is attack The City In The Sky & you have to go after it. It has the final mirror piece. This dungeon is good but very long & The Clawshot proves more useful than any other Zelda game. You also get another Clawshot where when your attached to something you can then grapple to wherever you need to go. The Arealfols that serve as the mini boss the 1st time I fought them they were hard but learning what to do now there no real problem. The traps you have to deal with are good too. This dungeon is long but the boss felt too easy to me. When you beat you'll have all 3 mirror pieces then you can go to The Twilight Realm a brief mention is about this object called a Sol you have to get it outside & place it in this holder. But you have this Zant Hand after it. Before you get it you have to fight Phantom Zant The Zant Hand can be the worst thing cause if when you moving it holder t holder if the hand grabs it & you don't stop it from leaving the room then you go to go all the way back to where The Sol is at do it all over again. You have to get 2 Sols outside & place them in their holders where your Master Sword will be powered up & you can cut through The Twilight Smoke. I had trouble looking for The Big Key & how they hid was smart. The battle with Zant is great how you have to fight him in all these different stages & a lot of your items come into play for each area. The battle outside Hyrule Castle rocks you just battle to the finish. Zant tells Link & Minda how it was Ganondorf that placed the curse on Minda not him & Ganondorf is going to resurrected him. Minda who has The Fused Shadow kills Zant. She is also worried about how she might of assembled something horrible. You have the most frustrating part of the game The Cave Of Ordeals & it more than lives up to it's name this is optional if you're not worried about getting all 60 Poe Souls then skip it. Hyrule Castle is the easiest dungeon in the whole game all you have to worry about is The Dark Nuts in the castle. You have to get the key & you fight King Bublin the last time who has the key after you defeat him he tells you all his life he has only followed the strongest side. Not much to say you have to get The Big Key & you get a cool cut scene where The Freedom Fighters help you out. The fight with Ganondorf is great in fact it's the best battle with Ganon ever imo. Ganondorf is in The Throne Room just sitting their I know he looks fat in the game. He posses Zelda you have to fight her & play Dead Man's Volley & then you fight him in beast form & you fight him in your wolf form. After you beat him Minda transports Link & Zelda out of there Minda transforms into some kind of creature & try's to finish Ganondorf off. Outside Ganondorf is holding Minda's Helmet & on horseback Zelda requests Light Arrows from The Goddess & you chase after Ganondorf with Epona you have to get close & let Zelda hit Ganondorf with a Light Arrow then you have to start stabbing or slashing at Ganondorf. You have this really good 1 on 1 sword fight with Ganondorf. Plus Ganondorf is finished off for good in this timeline anyway. It's an amazing battle. Then you have a nice ending. Now my final thoughts the story was a little a too deep for it's own good. Zelda & Ganondorf are barely in the game Ganon only comes into play at the end. But the combat system is great. You had very good temples bosses were good. A great item & tool selection. Cut scenes were either destubing or just amazing. Side quests were decent. The guide or partner Minda was good. The wolf portions I like more the 2nd time around. Decent music by Koji Kondo. I don't really get why this game gets hated on wouldn't this be the game that Ocarina Of Time & Majora's Mask fans would want. A lot of people call this a OOT rehash Other than a dude being from the forest & saving Zelda at the end I don't see it. I recommend this game if you haven't played it. It's on both The Wii & Gamecube you like it if you prefer the darker Zelda games.
